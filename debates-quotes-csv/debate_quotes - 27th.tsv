538272	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bernie Sanders	2019-06-27	Well, you are quite right. We have a new vision for America and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change, real change.

538273	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bernie Sanders	2019-06-27	And by that I mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for all single-payer system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538274	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bernie Sanders	2019-06-27	Under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now. I believe that education is the future for this country and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.

538278	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	What I meant by that is look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary middle-class Americans built America.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538279	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	My dad used to have an expression he said Joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity, it's about respect, it's being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything's going to be okay. Too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538280	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	What I am saying is that we've got to be straightforward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we (INAUDIBLE) situation where there's continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is--is--is clean and they--they have water that they can drink.

538283	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	Sure. So, college affordability is personal for us. Chasten and I have six figure student debt. I believe in reducing student debt. It's logical to me that if you can refinance your house you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. I also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538284	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	I just don't believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires. I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition. And while I want -- want tuition costs to go down I don't think we can buy down every last penny for that. Now, there's something else that doesn't get talked about in the college affordability debate. Yes, it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college. It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college. You should be able to live well, afford rent, be generous to your children--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News

You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up $12,000 a year per individual. So for the average family with two or three adults it would $24 to $36,000 a year.

538290	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	I'm still holding on to that torch. I want to make it clear to you, look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate for an education. The fact is that that's why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress. That's why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title I schools. That's why I think we should have universal Pre-K. That's why I think every single person who graduates from high school--65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education. That's why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college. That's why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out, they're making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen. No interest payment until they get beyond that. We can't put people in a position where they aren't able to go on and move on.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538291	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	And so, folks, there's a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century.

538304	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-06-27	So, on that point, part of the issue that is at play in America today, and we've all been traveling around the country, I certainly have, I'm meeting people who are working two and three jobs. You know, this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right? My great economy. My great economy. You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market. Well, that's fine if you own stocks. So many families in America do not. You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Well, yeah, people in America are working. They're working two and three jobs. So, when we talk about jobs, let's be very clear. In our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538305	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	Yeah, we've taught look, everybody who says Medicare for All, every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you're actually supposed to get from here to there.

538306	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	Now here's how I would do it. It's very similar. I would call it Medicare for All Who Want It. you take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, and you make it available on the exchanges it. People can buy in. and then if people like us are right that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538307	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	But, let's remember even in countries that have outright socialized medicine, like England, even there there's still a private sector, that's fine. It's just that for our primary care we can't be relying on the tender verses of the corporate system. This one is very personal for me. I started out this year dealing with a terminal illness of my father. I make decisions for a living and nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced. But, the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was gonna bankrupt our family because of Medicare.

538309	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	Look, this is a very personal to me. When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident my two boys were really very badly injured. I couldn't imagine what it'd be like had I not had adequate healthcare available immediately. And then when my son came home from Iraq after a year he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he was given months to live. I can't fathom what would have happened if, in fact, they said by the way the last six months of your life you're on your own. We're cutting off. You've used up your time.

538310	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	The fact of the matter is that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obama Care, to build on what we did.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News

The function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies. And, last year, if you could believe it, while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and I will lower prescription drug prices in half in this country, top ten companies made $69 billion in profit.

A mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico facing unknown peril to come here why would that mother do that? I will tell you. Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse. But what does Donald Trump do? He says go back to where you came from.

The children are with their families. We have to make sure that--that ICE is completely reformed. And they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way where they are addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border.

538345	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	Let's remember that's not just a theoretical exercise, that criminalization that is the basis for family separation. You do away with that it is no longer possible. Of course it wouldn't be possible anyway in my presidency because it is dead wrong. We have got to talk about one other thing because the Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion. Now our party doesn't talk about that as much largely for a very good reason which was we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion. But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it in for a party that associates itself with Christianity to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.

So, as Attorney General and the chief law officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest of public safety of their community.

This is not something to dismiss or wave away. And if you look at what China is doing. They're using technology for the perfection of dictatorship. But, their fundamental economic model isn't gonna change because of some tariffs. I live in the industrial Midwest. Folks who aren't in the shadow of a factory or somewhere near a soy field where I live. And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting. Tariffs are taxes.

A black man Eric Logan killed by a white officer. And I'm not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer says he was attacked with a knife, but he didn't have his body camera on. It's a mess. And we're hurting. And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community--all of the steps that we took from bias training to de-escalation but it didn't save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother's eyes I have to face the fact and nothing that I say will bring him back. This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country. And until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time. Not just from what has happened in the past but what's happening around the country in the present. It threatens the well being of every community. And I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing. A feeling not of fear but of safety. I'm determined to bring that day about.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News

I--there is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination. Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn't play with us because she--because we were black.

And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose bussing. And you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day and that little girl was me. So, I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly.

It represents an existential threat to us as a species. And the fact that we have a President of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact will be to our collective peril. I visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in California I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning. And on this issue it is a--it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now. That is why I support a Green New Deal. It is why I believe on day one and as President will re-enter us in the Paris agreement because we have to take these issues seriously and frankly, we have a President of the United States we talked about you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?
