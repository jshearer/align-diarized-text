♪♪ &gt;&gt;&gt; HI, THERE, EVERYONE. I'M MORGAN RADFORD. AND WELCOME TO SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC DEBATE OF THE 2020 ELECTION CYCLE HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW. THIS IS A LIVE LOOK AT THE DEBATE STAGE, WHERE IN JUST ABOUT AN HOUR, TEN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL TAKE THEIR PLACE AT THE PODIUM. AND INTERESTINGLY, THEY'RE ACTUALLY STANDING BASED ON THEIR PUBLIC POLLING. TAKING THE CENTER POSITION TONIGHT, ELIZABETH WARREN, FLANKED BY CORY BOOKER AND BETO O'ROURKE. AND JUST CONTEXT ABOUT HOW THIS NIGHT IS GOING TO WORK. THE CANDIDATES HAVE 60 SECONDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND THEN 30 SECONDS TO RESPOND TO FOLLOW-UPS. BEFORE TONIGHT BEGINS, WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MIGHT COME UP AND HOW DEBATES LIKE THESE HAVE SHAPED ELECTIONS OF THE PAST. &gt;&gt; THE DEBATES, THEY ARE FINALLY HERE. 20 CANDIDATES. AND WE COME TONIGHT WITH A FRONT-RUNNER. JOE BIDEN OUT IN FRONT OF THE PACK. HE'S BEING CHASED BY BERNIE SANDERS IN SECOND PLACE. A COUPLE OTHER CANDIDATES. ELIZABETH WARREN, KAMLA HARRIS. PETE BUTTIGIEG. AND THEN, YOU HAVE A LOT OF CANDIDATES OUT THERE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR MESSAGE OUT THERE. IT'S THE BIG QUESTION OF DEBATES -- DO THEY CHANGE THE RACE? AN IMPORTANT AND FUNDAMENTAL WAY? AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF PRIMARY DEBATES, YOU FIND A LOT OF MOMENTS THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE. WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THE BIGGEST ONES THROUGH THE YEARS. THIS ONE INVOLVED A FUTURE PRESIDENT. SOME SAY IT WAS THE MOMENT HIS PRESIDENCY -- ONE OF THE MOMENTS HIS PRESIDENCY WAS MADE. THIS WAS IN FEBRUARY OF 1980. HIS NAME WAS RONALD REAGAN. HE CAME INTO THAT CAMPAIGN AS THE REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER. BUT HE SUFFERED A BIG SURPRISE IN UPSET LOSS IN THE IOWA CAUCUSES. HE LOST TO GEORGE H.W. BUSH, IN THE IOWA CAUCUSES. A LOT OF PEOPLE HADN'T HEARD ABOUT GEORGE H.W. BUSH UNTIL THAT MOMENT. BUSH'S FAMOUS LINE, WHEN HE SAID I HAVE THE BIG MO NOW. NEW HAMPSHIRE IS THE NEXT TEST. BUSH CAUGHT REAGAN IN THE POLLS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE NOW KNOW IT. WHAT HAPPENED THE SATURDAY BEFORE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY? A DEBATE WAS HELD. IT WAS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL GYM OF NASHUA HIGH SCHOOL, NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE. THERE HAS BEEN A DISPUTE HOW TO ORGANIZE THE DEBATE. REAGAN'S CAMPAIGN PUT UP THE MONEY FOR THE DEBATE. 3,500 BUCKS IS WHAT IT COST. REAGAN'S CAMPAIGN PUT UP THE MONEY. REAGAN AND BUSH COME ON THE STAGE. THERE'S A MODERATOR THERE FROM "THE NATIONAL TELEGRAPH" NEWSPAPER. AND REAGAN GETS INTO A FIGHT, SOME SAY PICKS A FIGHT WITH THE MODERATOR. AND HE IS SAYING, THERE'S OTHER CANDIDATES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INCLUDED. HE SAID, TURN OFF HIS MICROPHONE. TURN OFF THE CANDIDATE'S MICROPHONE. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; YOU TURN THAT MICROPHONE OFF. &gt;&gt; I AM PAYING FOR THIS MICROPHONE. &gt;&gt; A GAME-CHANGING MOMENT. THERE WAS FIRE IN REAGAN'S DELIVERY THERE. BROUGHT THE CROWD TO ITS FEET. IT MADE BUSH LOOK SMALL. THAT SCENE PLAYED OUT, THE OTHER CANDIDATES, REAGAN GOT UP, HE SHOOK THEIR HANDS. AND BUSH WAS A BYSTANDER. REAGAN TOOK THE LEAD, ENDED UP WINNING NEW HAMPSHIRE, IN A LANDSLIDE OVER BUSH. WINNING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. REAGAN IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT. HE MAKES BUSH HIS V.P. BUSH BECOMES THE PRESIDENT. THAT WAS THAT MOMENT, IT SAVED THE REAGAN CAMPAIGN. SAVED WHAT WOULD BECOME THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS NBC'S STEVE KORNACKI. AND TONIGHT'S DEBATE IS SURE TO PAVE THE WAY FOR THE 2020 ELECTION. ALL TEN CANDIDATES ON STAGE TONIGHT WILL TRY TO STAND OUT AMONG THE SEA OF DEMOCRATS WHO ARE HOPING TO CHALLENGE PRESIDENT TRUMP NEXT NOVEMBER. HERE TO HELP ME PREVIEW WHAT WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE ON THE DEBATE STAGE, WE HAVE REPUBLICAN POLITICAL CONSULTANT, SIR MICHAEL SINGLETON. THANKS FOR JOINING US. HOW MUCH IS TONIGHT GOING TO BE ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLICIES? HOW DO THE CANDIDATES WALK THAT FINE LINE BETWEEN TRYING TO DISTINGUISH THEIR OWN PLATFORM BUT ALSO PROVING TO THEIR BASE THEY CAN TAKE PRESIDENT TRUMP ON? &gt;&gt; I THINK TONIGHT IS DOING A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH. THE SEPARATION AND THE PHOTOS FROM THE A.P. YESTERDAY OF THE DEAD MIGRANTS, THE FATHER AND THE DAUGHTER, I THINK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE IMMIGRATION POLICY DISCUSSION MORE OF A CENTRAL FOCUS, THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING INTO TONIGHT. I THINK THE CANDIDATES HAVE, BOTH, AN EQUAL TASK. THEY HAVE TO BOTH SAY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT. RIGHT? THE OVERRESPONSE WOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE MEAT ON THE BONES. YOU CAN'T SAY THE PLATITUDES THAT YOU USED TO SAY. NOW, IT'S AN EMERGENCY, WHICH REQUIRES A SERIOUS SOLUTION. I THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT PUTS ELIZABETH WARREN AND CASTRO WHO HAVE PUT TOGETHER SPECIFIC POLICY IDEAS, THAT GIVES THEM A LEG UP BECAUSE OF WHERE THE NEWS CYCLE IS RIGHT NOW. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY HAVE TO SAY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN DONALD TRUMP. WHO ARE THEY AS A PROGRESSIVE? IF THEY'RE A NEW CANDIDATE, WHO VOTERS AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH. OR MAYBE THEY KNOW ONE THING ABOUT ELIZABETH WARREN, LIKE THE DNA TEST. SHE HAS A PLAN BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE ABOUT HER AS A PERSON AND HER CHARISMA. IT'S A CHALLENGE ON BOTH SIDES. I THINK IMMIGRATION WILL BE THE POLICY FOCUS. &gt;&gt; YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT ABOUT HOW THE CANDIDATES WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES IN A FIELD THAT'S SO LARGE. SIR MICHAEL, WHEN I'VE BEEN IN THE FIELD, EVERY VOTER TELLS ME THEY WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THEY LOVE THAT HE'S ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT. &gt;&gt; I CALL TONIGHT THE NIGHT OF IDEAS. YOU HAVE CASTRO AND BOOKER AND WARREN. SOME OF THE MOST SUBSTANTIVE IDEA OF ALL OF THE 25 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE MOTIVATED -- VOTERS ARE MOTIVATED TO BEAT TRUMP. THEY DON'T CARE WHO THE NOMINEE IS. I THINK TONIGHT, FOR MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS ON THE STAGE, IT'S GOING TO BE -- NOT ONLY HOW CAN I GET IT DONE? EVEN IF YOU ARE ABLE TO WIN IN 2020, WHAT ABOUT THE SENATE? VOTERS WILL ASK, THESE ARE GREAT IDEAS. HOW CAN YOU GET IT DONE IN THIS DIVIDED CONGRESS? I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT THEY'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE IN MIAMI. FLORIDA IS A VERY, VERY CRITICAL STATE. DONALD TRUMP JUST RELAUNCHED HIS RE-ELECTION BID LAST WEEK IN CENTRAL FLORIDA. &gt;&gt; ALL EYES ON FLORIDA. &gt;&gt; WHY? THE LAST REPUBLICAN TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT FLORIDA WAS CALVIN COOLIDGE IN 1924. A REPUBLICAN CANNOT WIN THE WHITE HOUSE, ARGUABLY SPEAKING, WITHOUT FLORIDA. I THINK DEMOCRATS RECOGNIZE THIS. THE IDEA IS IF YOU CAN TAKE AWAY, A LITTLE BIT OF THE SUPPORT, DONALD TRUMP WON THE STATE BY 1.2%, THAT'S 100,000 VOTES, YOU COULD SEE A DEMOCRAT WIN IN 2020. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE FIRST PERSON TO BRING UP PUERTO RICO IS PROBABLY SOMEBODY WHO IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT DYNAMIC. &gt;&gt; YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT? &gt;&gt; I AGREE. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE LEADER OF TONIGHT'S PACK, ELISABETH WARREN. SHE IS POLLING AT ABOUT 13%. IS IT GOING TO BE A DISADVANTAGE TO NOT BE ON THE STAGE WITH JOE BIDEN, WHO IS REALLY THE FRONT-RUNNER OF ALL OF THE CANDIDATES? &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THAT'S A DISADVANTAGE AT ALL. VOTERS ARE TUNING IN FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT. THIS IS WHEN THE OPINIONS WILL BE CRYSTALLIZING. AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ELIZABETH WARREN TO SORT OF, I THINK, STRADDLE THAT FINE LINE THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT IN THE FIRST DEBATE, WHICH IS INTRODUCE HERSELF, SO THAT YOU CAN GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH DONALD TRUMP. BUT DON'T ENGAGE IN A FOOD FIGHT. VOTERS DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE NAGGING ON EACH OTHER. THEY WANT TO HEAR IDEAS AND IT HAS BEEN ELIZABETH WARREN LEADING THE BACK IN TERMS OF POLICY IDEAS AND BEING THE FIRST CANDIDATE TO VISIT THE HOMESTEAD FACILITY, WHICH IS 20 MILES AWAY FROM THE DEBATE FACILITY. I THINK FLORIDA IS AN INTERESTING -- TONIGHT IS AN INTERESTING CONFLUENCE OF EVENTS. YOU HAVE TRUMP ENGAING WITH ALL OF THIS IMMIGRATION, IT'S COMING TO A HEAD. HIS TREATMENT OF MIGRANT CHILDREN. BEING EXPOSED FOR WHAT IT IS, PRETTY APPALLING, HORRENDOUS CONDITIONS. &gt;&gt; NOW, WE HAVE THE IMAGES TO GO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; THE REPORT HAS A COPY OF THAT, WHICH IS EMBARRASSING, YOU KNOW, CONDITIONS THAT WERE KEEPING THESE CHILDREN IN. AND YOU HAVE THESE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE ALL COME TOGETHER. SOME HAVE IMMIGRATION PLANS AND OTHERS DON'T HAVE PLANS FOR THAT AT ALL. WHEN YOU HAVE THE THINGS LIKE THE CRISIS IN VENEZUELA GOING ON, AND THE VOTERS NOT BEING A M MONOLITH, IT'S IMPORTANT IN FLORIDA. &gt;&gt; I'M SO EXCITED I HAVE YOU HERE FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT. LET ME GO TO DR. BURNS, WHO IS WATCHING THE DEBATE WITH A FEW COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HOW IS IT GOING THERE? WHAT ARE THE YOUNG VOTERS SAYING? &gt;&gt; HAPPY DEBATE NIGHT. I HAVE AN AMAZING GROUP OF COLLEGE STUDENTS HERE FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS. WE HAVE WEST VIRGINIA REPRESENTED, FLORIDA, NEW YORK. A LOT OF DIFFERENT VIEWS AND OPINIONS. I WANT TO START YOU WITH YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE NIGHT. YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE FROM. THERE'S A LOT OF BIG NAMES ON THAT STAGE AND LESSER KNOWN ONES. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR FROM THE CANDIDATES AND FOR THE LESSER-KNOWN NAMES? WHAT CAN THEY DO TO CAPTURE YOUR INTEREST AND GET YOUR SUPPORT? &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY FOR THOSE CANDIDATES THAT ARE NOT WELL KNOWN TO TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM CRITICISM OF DONALD TRUMP. COMING FROM THE LIBERAL PERSPECTIVE. WE KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS. WE KNOW WHAT HE STANDS FOR. SO, RIGHT NOW, I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT SPECIFIC POLICY THEY'RE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE US. &gt;&gt; I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN SEEING JAY INSLEE. HE AND A FEW OTHER CANDIDATES MIGHT COME ACROSS AS A SINGLE ISSUE CANDIDATE. HE IS FOCUSED ON CLIMATE CHANGE. I THINK THAT'S THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE OF OUR TIME. I'M INTERESTED TO SEE THE PLAY BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER ISSUES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE UGLINESS OF CLIMATE REFUGEES IN THE NEXT FEW DECADES. AND I'M INTERESTED IN SEEING HE AMONG OTHER CANDIDATES ADDRESS THE PRESSING ISSUES OF OUR ECONOMY AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; YOU MENTION CLIMATE. A LOT OF SURVEYS SAY THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES FOR YOUNG VOTERS. WHO DO YOU THINK SO FAR HAS DONE THE BEST JOB OF SORT OF AUTHENTICALLY REACHING YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHICS? AND WHAT CAN CANDIDATES DO TO TAKE THAT TO THE NEXT LEVEL? I THINK HE'S DONE TO REACHING OUT TO THE YOUTH. ELIZABETH WARREN HAS DONE THE SAME. HE'S ONE OF THE LESSER KNOWN NAMES. FOR STUDENT DEBT. THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. THAT WOULD SET HIM APART FROM ALL OF THE CANDIDATES. THEY DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP. BUT WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. &gt;&gt; IN WEST VIRGINIA, WE'RE IN THE RUST BELT. AN HOUR SOUTH OF PITTSBURGH. EVERYONE IS LEAVING. THEY GET THEIR COLLEGE DEGREES OR IF YOU'RE FROM THERE, THEY'RE LEAVING. WHAT ARE THE CANDIDATES GOING TO DO TO HELP PEOPLE FIND JOBS IN THEIR HOME? THAT'S SO IMPORTANT. WHEN YOU HAVE A STATE THAT'S LOSING POPULATION, WHAT KIND OF JOBS ARE YOU GOING TO BRING TO THE TABLE SO PEOPLE CAN STAY HOME IN THAT ENTIRE PART OF AMERICA. AND THAT'S SO BIG. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED ON ACTUAL POLICY. AND IT'S EVEN KNOW, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR. HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THE CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP? OR SHOULD THEY AVOID THAT ALTOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AT KNOT AT ALL. THEY SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT TRUMP AT ALL. THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THEIR POLICIES. NO CANDIDATE HAS THAT MUCH TIME WHEN THEY CAN REALLY GO ON TO ALL OF THEIR POLICIES. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHICH POLICIES THEY FOCUS ON. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPEND ALL YOUR TIME TALKING ABOUT TRUMP OR GO OVER EVERYTHING BROADLY. THESE CANDIDATES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO PUT INTO THEIR CAMPAIGNS. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO STAY IN THEIR LANES. &gt;&gt; GOING OFF OF YOUR POINT AGAIN, IT'S LIKE THERE'S WAY TOO MANY CANDIDATES. THERE'S ONLY GOING TO BE SO MUCH TIME THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HEAR ABOUT SPECIFIC POLICIES THEY WANT TO PUT FORWARD. ME, PERSONALLY, I WANT TO SEE WHAT CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO ENDORSE PRISON REFORM. LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA HAS LED INTO THE CONVERSATION OF INCARCERATION OF THOSE THAT ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND REPARATIONS FOR THAT COMMUNITY, AS WELL. BEING SPECIFIC WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO OFFER US. A LOT OF TIMES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LIKES TO PANDER TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. BUT WHEN THEY GO INTO OFFICE, THEY DON'T PUT THE POLICIES INTO PLAY. &gt;&gt; A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. AND EVERY MINUTE COUNTS. &gt;&gt; WE ARE GIVEN FOOD FOR THOUGHT. JOY SAID THERE'S TOO MANY CANDIDATES. WE WANT TO KEEP TRACK FOR YOU GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. &gt;&gt;&gt; STAY WITH US RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW, AS WE HEAD INTO THE DEBATE IN LESS THAN ONE HOUR. &gt;&gt;&gt; THE IMAGE OF A FATHER AND DAUGHTER WHO DROWNED WHILE TRYING TO CROSS THE BORDER FROM MEXICO INTO THE UNITED STATES HAS BROUGHT MORE ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. AND SOME ARGUE THAT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE I.C.E. NEED TO BE ABOLISHED COMPLETELY. JACOB SOBOROFF BREAKS DOWN WHERE THE CANDIDATES STAND ON IMMIGRATION REFORM. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT IS 2020 TIME. WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO HELP YOU KEEP TRACK OF THE BIG ISSUES AND WHERE THE CANDIDATES STAND ON THINGS LIKE ABOLISHING I.C.E. WE LOOK AT CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL PART OF I.C.E. IS ITS REMOVAL OFFICE. UNDER PRESIDENT DEPORTED MORE PEOPLE THAN ANYBODY EVER, IT TARGETED UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S GOING AFTER PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY. SOME SAY THAT I.C.E. HAS GONE TOO FAR. AND SOME ARE ATTACKING THE ORGANIZATION. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND JOINED A HANDFUL OF OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY PUSHING FOR I.C.E. TO BE ABOLISHED ALTOGETHER. ADDING IMMIGRATION ISSUES WOULD BE SEPARATE FROM CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT. ELIZABETH WARREN FOLLOWED SUIT. SHE SAID BECAUSE TRUMP WAS SO, QUOTE, DEEPLY IMMORAL ON IMMIGRATION, THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE REFORMED. CASTRO IS CALLING FOR I.C.E. TO BE SPLIT UP AND GOING BACK TO DEPORTING ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT CRIMES OR ARE A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT. WHAT DO MOST AMERICANS THINK ABOUT ALL THIS? ONLY 24% OF AMERICANS ACTUALLY SUPPORT ABOLISHING THE AGENCY. AMONG DEMOCRATS, 43% SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET RID OF I.C.E. 34%, THINK IT SHOULD STAY. THIS, AMONG OTHER ISSUES, IS ONE OF THE POLICIES THAT WE'LL SEE HOW FAR LEFT THE DEMOCRATS DECIDE TO GO. &gt;&gt;&gt; WE'RE BRINGING BACK OUR PANEL TO DIVE DEEPER ON IMMIGRATION AND WHAT WE MIGHT EXPECT TO HEAR ON THE STAGE TONIGHT. WE HAVE A NEW ADDITION, ALEX THOMPSON. THE MARSHAL PROJECT SAID FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS, EVERY PRESIDENT HAS SEEN A GROWTH OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN DETENTION FACILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION. IS THERE ANY CANDIDATE YOU THINK THAT HAS A POLICY PLATFORM THAT CAN REVERSE THAT TREND? &gt;&gt; I THINK, CASTRO AND WARREN HAVE COME OUT TO REPEAL THE CRIMINALIZATION STATUTE OF PEOPLE THAT CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT CASTRO SAYS BECAUSE MUCH OF THAT CAMEBURG THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, WHEN HE WAS SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. &gt;&gt; IS THERE ANY POLICY PLATFORM YOU THINK WOULD SOLVE THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE? &gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM ANY OF THE CANDIDATES A POLICY THAT SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT WORKING WITH THOSE COUNTRIES. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU DECREASE CRIME. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TRIED BY PUMPING IN MONEY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENOUGH. I THINK YOU HAVE TO PUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND, POLICY FOLKS. MAYBE SEND SOME MILITARY IN TO TRAIN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE MILITARY. THIS WOULD BE A ROBUST INITIATIVE. IF YOU HELP LOWER CRIME, PEOPLE WON'T WANT TO COME TO AMERICA. YOU HAVE TO PUT MONEY IN TO REVIVAL THE ECONOMY, AS WELL. THAT'S A PROACTIVE, REALISTIC LONG-TERM STRATEGY. THAT COULD BE SUCCESSFUL AND RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD WAS THE ABOLISHMENT OF I. XRCHLT I.C.E. AND WE SEE SENATOR WARREN STARTING TO WALK BACK THE ENDORSEMENT OF ABOLISHING ICE. IF THEY SAY THEY. THAT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE POLICE ON THE BORDER PROTECTING PEOPLE, AMERICAN CITIZENS, FROM POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE TRYING TO CROSS, RIGHT? THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. BUT THE ISSUE IS COMPLICATED, IT'S A HARD DISTINCTION FOR CANDIDATES TO MAKE IN 60 SECONDS. I THINK THEY CAN BE MORE COMPASSIONATE IN THEIR LANGUAGE, TALKING ABOUT THE CAUSES TO WHY PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE. ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED IN 2015 WHEN I TRAVELED TO THE BORDER IN ARIZONA, BEFORE ALL OF THIS, WAS THAT I HAD IT WRONG. WE SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A BETTER LIFE. THEY'RE COMING HERE FOR WORK. TO CORRECT THAT, THEY ARE COMING HERE TO BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING CHARGED WITH ILLEGAL RE-ENTRY, WHICH IS THE TOP FELONY CHARGE IN THE UNITED STATES, HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED AND ARE TRYING TO GET BACK, REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. IF YOUR DAUGHTER, YOUR WIFE, YOUR SISTER, BROTHER, HERE ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER, AN INVISIBLE LINE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO BE REUNITED WITH YOUR WIFE OR YOUR BABY? AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN HUMAN TERMS, THAT FRAME, I THINK THE ISSUE RESONATES WITH PEOPLE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN SAYING THEY'RE DOING IT FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. ALSO, YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THAT UP WITH SPECIFIC PLANS ON HOW YOU NEED TO FIX THIS BROKEN SYSTEM. IT'S ALSO ABOUT EMPATHY AND THESE SANCTION WARE CITIES. A CITY LIKE NEW YORK IS A SANCTUARY CITY. IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN ISSUE THAT THESE CANDIDATES WHO ARE POLLING AT 1%, OR IN THE SINGLE DIGITS, COULD STAND OUT ON? LIKE MAYOR DE BLASIO. &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE INTERESTING. DEMOCRATS HAVE CREEDED A LOT OF THIS GROUND TO TRUMP IN THIS DEBATE. ONE THING YOU HEAR IS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. THERE'S FEW CANDIDATES GOING ON THE OFFENSE. THIS OPENS UP A LANE FOR SOMEONE LIKE MAYOR DE BLASIO WHO WANTS TO MAKE THIS A SIGNATURE ISSUE. &gt;&gt; WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US NOW. STAY TUNED TO NBC NEWS NOW. &gt;&gt;&gt; ASIDE FROM POLICY, ANOTHER WAY THAT DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS WITH STAND OUT, IS THROUGH THEIR WARDROBE. WE LOOK AT POWER DRESSING AND THE SENSATION OF APPEARANCE CAN BE AN ADVANTAGE FOR THE FEMALE CONTENDERS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE KNOWN TO DRESS BILLIE JEAN KING. WE DID DRESS HILLARY WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. ELIZABETH WARREN. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DEBATES AND HOW IT CHANGED THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT TELEVISION, THE KENNEDY/NIXON DEBATE. NIXON CAME IN AND HE CHOSE A LIGHTER-COLORED SUIT THAT BLENDED IN WITH THE BROUPD. KENNEDY WAS IN A DARKER SUIT. WHEN YOU'RE ON TELEVISION, YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE BACKGROUND IS GOING TO BE AND WHETHER THE COLOR YOU'RE WEARING WILL BLEND WITH THE BACKGROUND ORE CONFLICT WITH THE BACKGROUND. IT'S INTERESTING THAT MORE WOMEN ARE RUNNING, BUT TO THINK THAT THE GUY IN THE SUIT WITH THE RED TIE OR THE BLUE TIE IS POWERFUL. THE CHALLENGE THAT MOST OF UR IMAGES OF LEADERSHIP STILL IS MALE. I THINK THERE'S A STRONG, UNCONSCIOUS BIAS, FOR MEN, AS LEADERSHIP ROLES. &gt;&gt; EARLIER THIS MONTH, YOU SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE A, QUOTE, PRESIDENTIAL LOOK. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? &gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. &gt;&gt; WOMEN HAVE TO OVERCOME THAT AND PORTRAY THEMSELVES WITH AN IMAGE OF CONFIDENCE, WITH AN IMAGE OF AUTHORITY. BUT NOT TOO STRONG BECAUSE IF IT'S TOO STRONG, YOU'RE SEEN AS NOT LIKABLE. FOR WOMEN, I THINK A JACKET THAT LOOKS MORE EQUIVALENT TO A MAN'S SUIT, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, A BIT OF STYLE MATTERS. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHERE THE SLEEVES HIT, WHERE THE COLLAR, THE HIGH COLLAR, MAKES PEOPLE LOOK MORE CONFIDENT. I FIND THAT WOMEN WHO WEAR THREE-QUARTER LENGTH JACKETS LOOK MORE POWERFUL. WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT, IS CANDIDATES' POSITION AND THEIR MESSAGES AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF ELECTED. BUT BECAUSE WOMEN ARE GENERALLY DRESSING MORE INDIVIDUALLY, IT DOES BECOME A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION. AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT ADVANTAGE THAT WOMEN HAVE, TO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES AND THEIR STYLE AND SET THEMSELVES APART. WE'RE ALL MEMORABLE. WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND MAKE IT WORK FOR US. &gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF COLOR, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT COLORS ARE SOLID AND BRIGHT. BLUE IS A COLOR THAT ALMOST EVERYONE LIKES. RED IS FLATTERING FOR MOST PEOPLE. SOLID COLOR IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT ON TELEVISION. YOU CAN DO PATTERNS BUT NOT TOO BOLD. PASSION NOES ARE EASY. ANYTHING THAT IS BUSY IS NOT GOOD. ANYTHING THAT IS ILL FITTING IS NOT GOOD. MAYBE YOU WILL BE SITTING ON A STOOL. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW IT LOOKS WHEN YOU SIT AND STAND. MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION IS THAT YOU NOT WEAR A VERY EXPENSIVE DESIGNER PIECE. IT HAS TO LOOK FAMILIAR. IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT AND FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH. PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE CONSCIOUS THAT IMAGE MATTERS. ONCE PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU, IT'S ONLY A FEW SECONDS THAT THEY HAVE FORMED AN OPINION. SO, THE CLOTHING IS REALLY THE FIRST PART OF IT. THIS CLOTHING AND THE VISUAL IMAGE. PEOPLE TREAT YOU WITH MORE RESPECT AND THEY'RE MORE DIFFERENTIAL WHEN YOU ARE DRESSED WELL. &gt;&gt;&gt; BEYOND THE WARDROBE OF THE CANDIDATES, VOTERS SAY THEY ALSO CARE ABOUT THEIR WALLETS. A RECENT POLL BY REAL CLEAR OPINION RESEARCH FOUND THAT AMERICAN VOTERS RANK THE ECONOMY SECOND-MOST IMPORTANT ON THEIR LIST OF CONCERNS. THAT WAS BEHIND HEALTH CARE. LET'S BRING BACK OUR GUESTS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES OF TONIGHT. DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE MUCH ADO ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE ECONOMY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. HOW CAN DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES CONVINCE THEIR BASE THAT A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT CAN BRING A STRONGER ECONOMY THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP? &gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE PRESIDENT, HE'S LESS DISCIPLINED. MORE THAT HE TRIES TO PORTRAY THAT MESSAGE, MORE THAT THE DEMOCRATS' MESSAGE WILL RESONATE. THE WAY THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE TACKLING IT, FROM ALTERNATIVE POINTS OF VIEW, HOW CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS THE ECONOMY. AND LOOKING AT MORE FROM A HIGH-TO-LOW, RATHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL STOCK MARKET WHO IS BENEFITTING IN A TRADITIONAL WAY. THE PRESIDENT CAN USE THE ECONOMY TO THESE CANDIDATES' ADVANTAGES. &gt;&gt; AND YOU MENTIONED THE CLIMATE CHANGE, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE HEARD THE COLLEGE STUDENTS JUST MENTION. SHERMICHAEL, FOR A CANDIDATE LIKE INSLEE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT YOU MIGHT LOSE SOME OF THE BLUE COLLAR JOBS. HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THOSE VOTERS TO GET ONBOARD? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TALKING TO A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF VOTERS IN THE OVERALL DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IF YOU DO WIN THE GENERAL, YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH BROADER BASE OF PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO ARTICULATE TO. AND KEEP IN MIND, PRESIDENTS ARE DIFFICULT TO BEAT. ONLY THREE PRESIDENTS HAVE LOST RE-ELECTION. ONLY 3 IN THE PAST 100 YEARS. DESPITE HOW CRAZY DONALD TRUMP MIGHT BE, TO BE ABLE TO RUN ON A STRONG ECONOMY IS A VERY, VERY BIG DEAL. FOR THE DEMOCRATS, YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL INTO A TRAP OF BEATING UP ON EACH OTHER WHERE YOU BRING IN ALL OF THE COALITIONS, FACTIONS OF GROUPS OF PEOPLE. SOME FOLKS MAY STAY HOME BECAUSE THEIR GUY DIDN'T WIN, I.E. BERNIE SANDERS VOTERS. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE LOUD, SMALL PERCENTAGE, VOCAL GROUP WITHIN THE PARTY, PROGRESSIVE, LIKE THIS IDEA OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL, YOU CANNOT ISOLATE SOME OF THOSE BLUE COLLAR VOTERS WHO WE SAW IN 2016 VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. YOU LOOK AT THE PRECINCT MAP IN WISCONSIN AND IOWA, THEY VOTED FOR OBAMA TWICE. DON'T MAKE THOSE MISTAKES AGAIN. &gt;&gt; CANDIDATE DELANEY SAID THE GREEN, NEW DEAL WAS AS UNREALISTIC AS TRUMP'S PROMISE THAT MEXICO WAS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. TRUE OR FALSE? &gt;&gt; REPRESENTATIVE DELANEY HAS MADE -- WAS THE MODERATE CANDIDATE. NOW, THE ANTI-SOCIALIST, THE ANTI-BERNIE. ANYTIME THERE'S AN AGGRESSIVE PROPOSAL, LIKE THE GREEN NEW DEAL, MEDICARE FOR ALL, THESE GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO GO AFTER PROGRESSIVE AUDIENCES AND ANTAGONIZE THEM. TO HOPE THEY'RE NOT MODERATE PRIMARY VOTERS WHO WILL GET THEM THERE AND MAKE THAT BROAD APPEAL THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. IF HE MAKES THAT STATEMENT TODAY ON THE STAGE, I DON'T IMAGINE THE CROWD IS GOING TO BE CHEERING. &gt;&gt; AND THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE MORE MODERATE CANDIDATES, LIKE A KLOBUCHAR. EVEN BETO COMING FROM A RED STATE BACKGROUND. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO ADDRESS THEIR PARTY? I WANT TO GO BACK TO DASCHA BURNS. HOW IMPORTANT IS THE ECONOMY TO THE STUDENTS YOU'RE SPEAKING WITH TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT STUDENT DEBT. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A BIGGER AND BIGGER IMPACT ON THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY AND ON THE FUTURE OF YOUR GENERATION. GUYS, TONIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM THE CANDIDATES ON THIS, SPECIFICALLY? AND HOW BIG OF A FACTOR IS IT IN WHO GETS YOUR VOTE AND GETS YOUR SUPPORT? &gt;&gt; I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF US THAT WOULD GET OUR SUPPORT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDENTS. GOING INTO THIS ECONOMY. AND THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF OPINIONS ON THE STUDENT DEB RELIEF OR FORGIVENESS. IDEAS THAT CANDIDATES HAVE. I WILL LOOK FOR THEM TO ARTICULATE THEIR PLANS FOR STUDENT DEBT. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT WILL BE GOOD. 1.5 TRILLION JUST FROM STUDENT DEBT. NOT ONLY HOW THEY PROVIDE FREE COLLEGE, BUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH THE DEBT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND TO AVOID THAT FUTURE STUDENTS GET ON THAT DEBT. &gt;&gt; SPEAKING OF AFTER COLLEGE, WHO IS THINKING ABOUT AND WORRIED ABOUT GETTING A JOB AFTER YOU GRADUATE? HAVE THESE CANDIDATES DONE ENOUGH TO ARTICULATE HOW THEY'RE PLANNING TO INVEST IN YOUR FUTURES? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; CAN THEY DO THAT TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; MAYBE IN TIME. BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM DO THAT. THE VOTER BASE IS A HUGE PART OF THE POPULATION. AND I THINK OUR VOTES COULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; IT WILL REQUIRE TO DEFINE WHAT EDUCATION IS TONIGHT. IT REQUIRES GOING BEYOND THE FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE MODEL. TO BE MORE IN APPRENTICESHIPS AND CO-OPS AND UNIVERSITY. THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OF THE FUTURE. IT WON'T ALL BE THE FOUR-YEAR DEGREE. &gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT TO SEE MORE OPTIONS? YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WEST VIRGINIA AND WHAT THE JOB MARKET IS LIKE THERE. CAN YOU TALK MORE ABOUT THAT? &gt;&gt; WE SAW THE BLUE COLLAR JOBS. THE FOSSIL FUEL AND THE ENERGY INDUSTRY IS HARD HIT UNDER THE EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A REVIVAL OF THOSE INDUSTRIES UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. I THINK IT WILL BE IMPORTANT, THAT PLACES LIKE WEST VIRGINIA, WE SEE INVESTMENT IN ALL KINDS OF TRAINING PROGRAMS, IN COST TUITION IS SOMETHING ELSE, THAT IS CONCERNING TO WEST VIRGINIANS. WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY WHERE I GO, IS KNOWN AS CROSS COUNTRY FOR ITS CHEAP TUITION. BUT TUITION IS GOING UP EVERY YEAR. THAT GOES BACK TO STUDENT DEBT, ARE THE CANDIDATES GOING TO LOOK AT THE COST OF SCHOOL? AND RETHINKING EDUCATION. IT WILL TAKE ALL WALKS OF LIFE TO GO TO TECHNICAL SCHOOL AND COLLEGES. A PLACE LIKE WEST VIRGINIA, WE'RE LOSING WHITE AND BLUE COLLAR JOBS. I WANT TO SEE HOW THEY REINVEST THE MONEY. &gt;&gt; I WANTED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION -- &gt;&gt; I WANT TO ADDRESS -- &gt;&gt; I WANT TO JUMP IN BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT KRISTEN AND VALENTINA SAID. YOU TALKED ABOUT COMMUNICATING THE PLATFORM. YOU TALKED ABOUT CASTRO. HE'S GONE ON TO RADIO SHOWS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CANDIDATES YOU LIKE? ARE YOU FINDING THEM ONLINE? FINDING ADS ON THE TELEVISION? HOW ARE YOU FINDING THE CANDIDATES YOU LIKE? YOU THINK SOCIAL MEDIA. NOT ONLY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT ONLINE. HE'S BEEN GREAT IN SOCIAL MEDIA. WHAT I THINK HAS BEEN GREAT, IS ALL OF THE CANDIDATES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HE'S BEEN GREAT COMMUNICATING HIS POLICIES. THEY GET TEN-SECOND VIDEOS. THAT'S SHORT VIDEOS AND TEXT. CLOSER TO THE POLICY EVEN IF IT'S JUST THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEOS AND TEXT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN STRIKING A BRAND AND GETTING TO THE NITTY-GRITTY OF YOUR POLICY. BETO O'ROURKE HAS A GREAT IMAGE. HE'S ATTRACTIVE, GREAT OVERALL BRANDING, VERSUS SOMEBODY WHO IS MORE IN DEPTH ABOUT HIS POLICY ISSUES. STRIKING THAT BALANCE IS IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; WHAT RESONATES TO YOUR GENERATION? THE BRAND OR THE SUBSTANCE? &gt;&gt; THE BRAND DRAWS YOU IN. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR ANY OF THE CANDIDATES TO PUT ALL OF THEIR POLICIES ON TO SOCIAL MEDIA. LIKE ON TWITTER, YOU CAN ONLY USE SO MANY CHARACTERS. BUT WHAT THEY CAN DO IS GET ENOUGH SUPPORT AND INTERACT WITH PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE AND GET THEM INTERESTED ENOUGH TO SAY, OH, WHY DON'T I GO ON THIS PERSON'S WEBSITE AND GO DEEPER INTO WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO? &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE WE ARE THE GENERATION THAT'S VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON POLICY, AS WELL. AND THAT MAKES US DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF OUR PARENTS' GENERATION. WE WANT SPECIFIC ANSWERS FOR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, BRINGING UP THAT POINT ABOUT HOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LIKES TO PANDER TO A LOT OF THOSE WITHIN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, WHICH IS A BIG REASON WHY HILLARY CLINTON MOVED THAT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH POLITICIANS SAYING ONE THING AND DOING SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE OF THE OFFICE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THEY'LL HAVE TO TELL US WHO THEY ARE TONIGHT AND BRING THAT SUBSTANCE. &gt;&gt; SUBSTANCE AND STYLE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US RIGHT HERE ON NBC NOW. &gt;&gt;&gt; THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, MANY CANDIDATES HAVE TAKEN TO THE PRIMARY DEBATE STAGE TO SELL THEIR MESSAGE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHILE SOME HAVE SUCCEEDED AND OTHERS FADED INTO THE BACKGROUND, OR THEY MADE CRITICAL FAUX PASS. DASHA BURNS DIGS INTO THE ARCHIVES TO FIND OUT WHAT STOOD OUT IN DEBATES OF THE PAST AND HOW THE MEDIMEDIA-ANOINTED WINN FARED IN THE ACTUAL ELECTION. &gt;&gt; LET'S DIG INTO THE ARCHIVES TO SEE WHAT HISTORY SAYS ABOUT HOW MUCH THE MOMENTS HAVE THESE EVENTS ACTUALLY STICK. ♪♪ SO, I WANT TO START IN 1960. I'M GOING TO GO TO THE JFK LIBRARY YOUTUBE PAGE FOR THIS. NO, I AM NOT LOOKING FOR THAT FAMOUS NIXON/KENNEDY DEBATE. EVERYBODY THINKS THAT WAS THE FIRST BIG TELEVISED DEBATE. THERE WAS ACTUALLY A PRIMARY DEBATE EARLIER THAT YEAR QUEEN TO KENNEDY AND HUBERT HUMPHREY. THIS TAPE WAS LOST FOR DECADES. THEN IT WAS FOUND. &gt;&gt; I FEEL THE USE OF THE TEST LAWS TO PURCHASE POWER AND BROADEN THE BASE OF THE CONSUMERS, THE CONSUMPTION ABILITY OF THE PEOPLE IS VERY IMPORTANT. I DO AGREE THAT WE OUGHT TO TRY TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE. THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. UNTIL WE DO IT, UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO BRING IN ENOUGH REVENUE TO BRING UP THE LOSS, I CANNOT ADVOCATE AT THIS TIME THAT REDUCTION IN TAXES. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SEE HOW THIS PLAYED BACK THEN AND HOW WE COVERED IT. THIS IS SOME MICROFILM THAT HAD SOME HEADLINES FROM THE DAY. WE'RE LISTENING FOR -- HOW DID THAT DEBATE GO DOWN? KENNEDY WAS MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEBATE. THE NEW ENGLANDER WENT INTO THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AS THE UNDERDOG AND HE STILL IS. BUT HE MADE A MORE VISIT AND EFFECTIVE PRESENTATION OF HIS CASE. HE WASN'T MUCH OF AN UNDERDOG FOR LONG. YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE REST. HE WENT ON TO DEBATE RICHARD NIXON IN A FACEOFF HE FAMOUSLY WON AND BEAT HIM IN THE GENERAL. NOW, I'M LOOKING FOR FOOTAGE FROM 1972. THIS IS ON FILM. YES, REAL FILM. AND THIS IS NBC'S FILM LIBRARY. WE DIGITIZE OLD FILM FOOTAGE. MARCH 1972, NEW HAMPSHIRE. LET'S CHECK THIS OUT. THIS WAS THE FIRST TELEVISED DEBATE SINCE THE 1960 ELECTION. A DECADE BEFORE CANDIDATES WOULD DEBATE ON BROADCAST TELEVISION AGAIN. CRITICS THOUGHT THEY WERE USELESS. THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS WERE EDMUND MUSKIE AND GEORGE McGOVERN. IT DID NOT GO OVER WELL. ALL OF THE PAPERS PANNED THIS DEBATE. THERE'S REPORTS OF PEOPLE CALLING IT A DEBACLE. DEMOCRACY DYING A SLOW DEATH. AND ANOTHER PAPER SAID THE RAT ONES. IN THE DEBATE, ONE OF THE CANDIDATES PULLED OUT A RUBBER RAT. YEAH. GEORGE McGOVERN GOT THE NOMINATION BUT HE LOST TO NIXON. HE KIND OF GOT LOST TO HISTORY, TOO. NOW, I WANT TO HUNT DOWN A TAPE FROM 1984. IT WAS JANUARY. AND REAGAN'S POLL NUMBERS WERE NOT LOOKING SO GOOD. AND SO, A BUNCH OF DEMOCRATS DECLARED THEIR CANDIDATE. HERE WE GO. AND THE FIRST PRIMARY DEWAIT KICKS THINGS OFF WITH A BANG. AND GOT A TON OF PRESS COVERAGE, RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS. YESTERDAY, WAS IT GOOD POLITICS, GOOD THEATER OR BOTH? &gt;&gt; IT WAS BOTH. THIS IS SOME OF THE FIREWORKS THAT THE VIEWERS SAW YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. &gt;&gt; I WORKED THIS OUT CAREFULLY. I PLEDGED AND CAN ACHIEVE IT, TO REDUCE THE REAGAN DEFICIT BY MORE THAN HALF. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SAME GOBBLEDYGOOK WE'VE BEEN HEARING THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN. &gt;&gt; THE DEBATE MODERATED BY PHIL TED KOPPEL AND PHIL DONAHUE, WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A SHOUTING MATCH. &gt;&gt; WHO HAS THE FLOOR? &gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN A SIX-MINUTE SPEECH, ALL OF IT BALONEY. &gt;&gt; MAYBE THAT WAS PRETTY MILD COMPARED TO TODAY. FOR BACK THEN, IT WAS PRETTY FIERY. I LOVE THESE HEADLINES FROM THE WASHINGTON, D.C. WALTER F. MONDALE AND SENATOR JOHN GLEN OF OHIO, ACCUSE EACH OTHER AFTER GOBBLEDYGOOK AND BALONEY TODAY. MONDALE WAS CRUSHED BY RAGEN IN THE GENERAL, WHO WON ALL BUT ONE STATE. THIS SHOULD BE A WARNING TO DEMOCRATS TODAY. EVEN WITH REAGAN SLUMPING IN THE POLLS GOING INTO THE RACE, AND A MASSIVE FIELD OF BIG-NAME DEMOCRATS, THEY DIDN'T COME CLOSE TO UNSEEDING THE INCUMBENT. &gt;&gt;&gt; THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IS JUST MINUTES AWAY. AS VIEWERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES TUNE IN TO WATCH THESE TEN DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS, DISCUSS SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE COUNTRY. SHERMICHAEL, ZERLINA, BACK WITH US IN THE STUDIO. ALEX, IS THERE ANYONE TONIGHT YOU THINK CAN STEAL ELIZABETH WARREN'S THUNDER? &gt;&gt; I WOULD LOOK AT AMY KLOBUCHAR. SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO DISTINGUISH HERSELF FROM WARREN'S BIG, HUGE, FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE PLAN. SHE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A FEW THINGS TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD. REALLY TO BREAK OUT THIS SEASON AND ESTABLISH HERSELF. &gt;&gt; DO YOU AGREE? YOU'RE NODDING YOUR HEAD. &gt;&gt; I THINK AMY KLOBUCHAR IS THE MOST DIFFERENT FROM THOSE TOP FIVE FOLKS. &gt;&gt; SHE'S MODERATE. &gt;&gt; SHE'S THE ONE PERSON IN TONIGHT'S DEBATE THAT COULD CHALLENGE JOE BIDEN IN THAT RING. NOBODY ELSE IS GOING FOR THAT LANE. I THINK THERE'S AN OPENING. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT RESONATES WITH THE BASE OF THE PARTY. YOU NEED THOSE PEOPLE ORGANIZING AND KNOCKING ON DOORS AND FUND-RAISING AND MAKING CALLS TO GROW YOUR COALLATION. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE BASE THAT WOULD SUPPORT HER. BUT SHE HAS A MESSAGE AND CAN VIE FOR THAT CENTRAL LANE. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT ACTIVIST ENERGY? WHO ARE THE CONTENDERS WE'LL SEE TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; I THINK CASTRO WILL DO WELL. I'LL TELL YOU WHY. MEMBERS OF THE HISPANIC PEOPLE, THEY ARE THE FAST EVIDENT GROWING MINORITY GROUP IN THIS COUNTRY. WE SAW IN 2018, THEY ARE MOBILIZING. THEY ARE LEARNING THE POLITICAL PROCESS. THEY ARE BECOMING ENGAGED AND INVOLVED. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT POLICY HE WILL TRY TO TALK ABOUT BEING AS CONCISE OF POSSIBLE. THAT WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT HISPANICS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BRINGING BOTH GROUPS TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I THINK CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, WHICH IMPACTS HISPANICS. I THINK VOTING, EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. THOSE ISSUES ARE PIVOTAL THAT THOSE GROUPS CAN SAY, I'M BLACK BUT I AGREE WITH MY HISPANIC BROTHERS ON THIS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS US BOTH. &gt;&gt; ALSO, WHERE DO WE STAND AS AMERICANS, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WE SEE A LIVE PICTURE HERE OF THE CANDIDATES TAKING THE STAGE. THEY'RE TAKING POSITION IN THE MOST RECENT POLL. IS THERE ANYTHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR TONIGHT, OR ASKING OURSELVES AS CITIZENS, WHILE WE'RE WATCHING? I THINK I'M GOING TO BE LISTENING FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. THAT WAS AN ISSUE NOT BROUGHT UP, NOT ASKED BY A QUESTION UNTIL HILLARY CLINTON BROUGHT IT UP HERSELF IN THE DEBATE. THERE WERE NO QUESTIONS ABOUT ABORTION. NO QUESTIONS ABOUT FUNDING FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND GIVING BACK OF REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. THAT BEING AN ISSUE IN GEORGIA AND MISSOURI, PASSING RESTRICTIVE LAWS TO GO OUT WHERE WE WERE, THESE CANDIDATES NEED TO SPEAK CLEARLY AND LOOK LIKE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR AMERICAN WOMEN. WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS ELECTION, JUST LIKE THEY WERE IN 2018 AND IN 2016. ALL THE ELECTIONS PREVIOUSLY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S INTERESTING. THIS CYCLE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF ISSUES COME TO THE, HOPEFULLY, THE DEBATE STAGE. BUT ALSO IN THE ELECTION CYCLE THAT WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE. REPARATION, RIGHT? OR THE GREEN NEW DEAL. THESE WERE ONCE THOUGHTS THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER IN YOUR FRESHMAN DORM POLICY SCI CLASS. ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR OR LISTEN FOR THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DISCUSSED OR REPORTED? &gt;&gt; I JUST THINK BECAUSE OF THE EVENT OF THE DAY, IMMIGRATION IS GOING TO BE TOP OF MIND FOR EVERYBODY. I WOULD BE CURIOUS IF ANY OF THE CANDIDATES GO BEYOND COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. AND ARTICULATE A POSITIVE, A DIFFERENT VISION FOR IMMIGRATION, WHETHER BETO O'ROURKE FROM THE BORDER OR CASTRO, THE ONLY LATINO CANDIDATE IN THE RACE. &gt;&gt; AS THEY ARTICULATE THAT, WE HEARD THE STUDENTS SAY THEY WANT THE STYLE AND THE SUBSTANCE. BUT IS THIS AN OPENING NIGHT ABOUT STYLE? ARE THESE CANDIDATES GOING TO TRY TO GRAB THE TOMORROW MORNING HEADLINES? &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; I WORKED FOR ROMNEY, GINGRICH AND CARSON. I'VE BEEN TO EVERY PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WITH THOSE THREE INDIVIDUALS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MOMENT THAT TOMORROW MORNING'S HEADLINES WILL SAY, DID YOU SEE WHAT SO AND SO SAID? PARTICULARLY NOW BECAUSE THE DYNAMICS HAVE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE SO INSTANTANEOUS. &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY IT'S A LITTLE QUICKER THAN 2016. FOR NOW, THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHTS AND DISCONVERSATION. NOW, WE HAVE TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THAT. THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNS WILL HAVE TO NAVIGATE A NEW TERRAIN THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; A NEW TERRAIN WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE THEM NAVIGATE AS WE SPEAK. YOU CAN SEE THE CANDIDATES THERE LINING UP ON THE PODIUM. WATCH THIS ON NBC NEWS, ON TELEMUNDO, ON MSNBC. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A BIG THANK YOU TO ZERLINA, SHERMICHAEL, ALEX AND JACKIE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BACK AFTER THE DEBATE WITH MORE ON OUR PANEL, AS WELL AND ANALYSIS FROM THESE GUYS. FOR NOW, WE HAND IT OVER TO OUR TEAM IN MIAMI. WE HOPE THAT YOU ENJOY WATCHING THIS DEBATE AS MUCH AS WE WILL. SEE YOU SOON. ♪♪ &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. I'M LESTER HOLT AND WELCOME TO THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC DEBATE IN THETH 2020 RACE FOR PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; I'M SAVANNAH GUTHRIE. WE'LL BE JOINED BY OUR COLLEAGUES, CHUCK TODD AND RACHEL  MADDOW. &gt;&gt; WHAT SETS THESE CANDIDATES APART AND WHICH OF THESE HOPEFULS HAS WHAT IT TAKES? &gt;&gt; NOWIN IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT. &gt;&gt; TONIGHT, ROUND 1, NEW JERSEY SENATOR CORY BECOMER, JEWEL LAN CASTRO, BILL DEE APPLAUSE OWE, MINNESOTA SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR, FORMER TEXAS CONGRESSMAN BETO O'ROURKE. THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DEBATE, LIVE FROM MIAMI, FLORIDA. [ APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING. WELCOME TO THEHE CANDIDATES ANDO OUR AUDIENCE HERE IN MIAMI AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ON MANY OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES OF THE MOMENT INCLUDING IMMIGRATION, THE SITUATION UNFOLDING AT OUR BORDER AND THE TREATMENT OFOF MIGRANT CHILDREN &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TENSIONS WITH IRAN, CLIMATE CHANGE AND OF COURSE WE'LLLL TA ABOUTSE THE ECONOMY. THOSE KITCHEN-TABLE ISSUES SO MANY AMERICANS FACE EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; QUICK RULES, 20 CANDIDATES QUALIFIED FOR THIS FIRST DEBATE, WE'LL HEAR FROM 10 TONIGHT AND 10 MORE TOMORROW. THE BREAKDOWN WAS SELECTED AT RANDOM. THE CANDIDATES WILL HAVE 60 SECONDS TO ANSWER AND 30 SECONDS FOR ANY FOLLOW UPS. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THIS LARGE FIELD, NOT EVERY PERSON WILL BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON EVERY TOPIC. BUT OVEROV THE COURSE OF THE NE TWO HOURS, WE WILL HEAR FROM EVERYONE. WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUDIENCE TO KEEP THEIR REACTIONS TO A MINUTE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SHY ABOUT MAKING SURE THE CANDIDATES STICK TO TIME TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO GET TO IT. WE'LL START WITH SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. GOOD EVENINGEL TO YOU. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE MANY PLANS, FREE COLLEGE, FREE CHILDCARE, GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE, CANCELLATION OF STUDENT DEBT, NEW TAXES, NEW REGULATIONS, THE BREAK UP OF MAJOR CORPORATIONS. BUT THIS COMES AT A TIME WHERE 71% OF AMERICANS SAY THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO WORRYY THIS KIND OF CHANGE COUL BEBE RISKY TO THE ECONOMY? &gt;&gt; I THINK OF IT THIS WAY, WHO IS THIS ECONOMY REALLY WORKING FOR? IT'S GOING GREAT FOR THE SLICE AT THE TOP. IT'S DOING GREAT FOR GIANT DRUG COMPANIES. IT'S NOT DOING GREAT FOR PEOPLE TRYING TOO GET A PRESCRIPTION FILLED. IT'S DOING GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO INVEST IN PRIVATE PRISON, JUSTPR NOT FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICANSTI WHO'S LIVES ARE DESTROYED AND WHO'S COMMUNITIES AREE RUINED. IT'S DOING GREAT FOR GIANT OIL COMPANIES WHO WANT D TO DRILL EVERYWHERE, NOT T JUST FOR THE REST US WHO ARE WATCHING CLIMATE CHANGE BEAR DOWN ON US. WHEN YOU GOT A GOVERNMENT, AN ECONOMY THAT DOES GREAT FOR THOSE WITH MONEY AND NOT FOR EVERYONE ELSE, THAT IS CORRUPTION, PURE AND SIMPLE, WE NEED TO CALL IT OUT, ATTACK IT HEAD ONK  AND WE NEED TO MAKE STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN M OUR GOVERNMENT, ECONOMY AND IN OUR COUNTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, YOU CALLED PROGRAMS LIKE FREE COLLEGE, SOMETHING YOU MIGHT DO IF YOU WERE A MAGIC GENIE, IS IT GIVING YOUR VOTERS A FALSE SENSE OF WHAT'S ACHIEVABLE. &gt;&gt; FIRST THE ECONOMY, WE KNOW NOT EVERYONE IS SHARING IN THIS PROSPERITY AND DONALD TRUMP SITS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND GLOATS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE AFFORDING COLLEGE AND THEIR PREMIUMS. I DO GET CONCERNED ABOUT PAYING FOR COLLEGE FOR RICH KIDS, I DO. BUT I THINK MY PLAN IS AND A GOOD ONE. AND MY PLAN WOULD BE TO FIRST OF ALL MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES S THAT TOP PERCENTILE GS HELP WITHDE THEIR EDUCATION. MY OWN DAD AND MY SISTER GOT THEIR FIRST DEGREES WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS WELL AS CERTIFICATIONS. I'D USE PELL GRANTS, I'LL DOUBLE THEM FROM 6,000 TO $12,000 A YEAR AND EXPAND IT TO THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES THAT GET COVERED, FAMILIES THAT MAKE UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSANDTH DOLLARS. AND THE THIRD THING I WOULD DO, IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO PAY OFLOF THEIR STUDENT LOANS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TIME, THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; WHAT WE'VE BEENEN DISCUSSING AND TALKINMAG ABOUT IS HOW MUCH FUNDAMENTAL OF THE ECONOMY IS DESIRABLE AND DO IT. SOME WANT A TAX RATE OF 70%. WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT? IFAR NOT, WHAT WOULD YOUR TOP INDIVIDUAL RATEUL BE? &gt;&gt; THIS ECONOMY HAS GOT TO WORK FOR EVERYONE. AND RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT IT ISN'T AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES. [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT FAVORS THOSE WHO CAN PAY FOR ACCESS AND OUTCOMES. THAT'S HOW YOU EXPLAIN AN ECONOMY THAT IS RIGGED THE CORPORATIONS AND THE VERY, WELL, WEALTHYIST. A NEW DEMOCRACY THAT ISIN REVIV BECAUSE WE RETURN POWER TO THE PEOPLE, NO GERRYMANDERING, AUTOMATIC AND SAME-DAY VOTER REGULATION ANDND A NEW VOTING RIGHTS ACT TO GET RID OF THE BARRIERS. &gt;&gt; WOULDLD YOU SUPPORT A 70% INDIVIDUALAL MARGINAL TAX BREAK? &gt;&gt; I WOULD SUPPORT A TAX CODE THAT IS I FAIR TO EVERYONE? &gt;&gt; 70%? &gt;&gt; TAKE THAT CORPORATE RATE UP TO 28%. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TIME. THAT'S TIME, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; SENATOR BOOKER, THERE IS A DEBATE IN THIS PARTY RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE ROLE OF CORPORATIONS AS YOU KNOW. SENATOR WARREN PUT OUT A PLAN TO BREAK UP TECH COMPANIES. YOU SAID WE SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING AROUND POINTING AT COMPANIES AND BREAKING THEM UP WITHOUT ANY KIND OFOF PROCESS. WHY DO YOU DISAGREE? &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK I D DISAGREE. I THINK WE HAVE A SEVERE PROBLEM IN YOUR COUNTRY WITH CORPORATE  CONSOLIDATION. WE SEE THAT BECAUSE CONSUMERS PRICES ARE BEING RAISED BY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND YOU SEE THAT BY JUST THE FACT THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY AN ECONOMY THAT IS HURTING SMALL BUSINESSES AND NOT ALLOWING THEM TO COMPETE. ONE OFAG THE MOST AGGRESSIVE BIS IN THE SENATE IS THE AG SECTOR. SO I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE NEED TO CHECK THE CORPORATE CONSOLIDATION AND LET THE FREE MARKET WORK. AND I LIVE IN A LOW-INCOME BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY. I SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THIS ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING FOR AVERAGE AMERICANS. THEER INDICATORS THAT ARE BEING USED FROM GDP TO WALL STREET'S RANKING IS NOT HELPING PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST THE WELL WEALTHYIST IN OUR NATION. &gt;&gt; YOU SAID IT WASN'T RIGHT TO NAME NAMES AND SINGLE THEM OUT. WHY IS THAT? &gt;&gt;S  AGAIN, I WILL SINGLE OUT COMPANIES LIKE HALLIBURTON OR AMAZON THAT PAY NOTHING IN TAXES. WHEN IT COMES TO ANTI-TRUST LAW, I WILL APPOINTMENT JUDGES THAT WILL ENFORCE IT, HAVE A DOJ THAT WILLFE GO THROUGH THE PROCESSES NECESSARY TO CHECK THIS KIND OF CORPORATE CONCENTRATION. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TOO MUCHCH OF A PROBLEM WITH CORPORATE POWER GROWING. WE SEE IT WITH CITIZENS UNITED. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT FIGHTS FOR THE PEOPLE INVE THE COUNTRY WHO NEE TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S A CHAMPION FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; SENATOR WARREN, I MENTIONED YOU. ARE YOU PICKING WINNERS AND LOSS LOSSERS. &gt;&gt; THERE'S WAY TOO MUCH CONSOLIDATION RIGHT NOW IN GIANG INDUSTRIES IN THIS COUNTRY. IT HURTS WORKERS, SMALL BUSINESSES, INDEPENDENT FARMERS, IT HURTS OUR ECONOMY OVERALL AND IT HELPS CONSTRICT REAL INNOVATION AND GROWTH IN THIS ECONOMY. WE'VE HAD THE LAWS OUT THERE FOR A LONG TIME TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT BACK. WHAT'S BEENN MISSING IS COURAGE. COURAGE IN WASHINGTON TAKE ON THE GIANTS. THAT'S PART OF THE CORRUPTION IN THIS SYSTEM. IT HAS BEEN FAR TOO LONG THAT THE MONOPOLIES HAVE BEEN MAKING THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, HAVE BEENNS FUNDING THE SUPER PACS, HAVE BEEN OUT THERE MAKING SURE THAT THEIR INFLUENCE IS HEARD AND FELT IN EVERY SINGLE DECISION THAT GETS MADE IN WASHINGTON. WHERE I WANT TO START THIS IS I WANT TO RETURN GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE AND THAT MEANS CALLING OUT THE NAMES OF THE MONOPOLISTS AND SAYING I HAVE THE COURAGE TO GO AFTER AFTER THEM. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]ME &gt;&gt; SECRETARY CASTRO, DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN TALKINGON ABOUT THE P GAP FOR DECADES. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN ARE PAID FAIRLY IN THIS COUNTRY? &gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION, LESTER. I GREW UP WITH A MOTHER WHO RAISED MY BROTHER AND ME AS A SINGLE PARENT AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKEE TO STRUGGLE, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO RENT A HOME AND TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLEE TO PAY THE RENT AT THE FIRST OF THE MONTH AND TO SEE A MOM WORK VERY, VERY HARD AND KNOW THAT MOMS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE GETTING PAID LESS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE WOMEN. I WOULD DO SEVERAL THINGS STARTING WITH SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE DONEHA A LONG TIME O WHICH IS TO PASS THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT FINALLY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND ALSO PURSUE LEGISLATION SO THAT WOMEN ARE PAID EQUAL PAY FORR EQUAL WORK IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S PAST TIME THAT WE DID THAT. AND WE HAVE TO DO THIS. IF WE WANT TO BE THE MOST PROSPEROUS NATION IN THE 21st CENTURY. WE NEEDUR TO MAKE SURE THAT WOM ARE PAID WHAT THEY DESERVE. &gt;&gt; PUT THE SAME QUESTION TO CONGRESSWOMAN GABBARD. &gt;&gt; LET'S RECOGNIZE THE SITUATION WE'RE IN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PUT YOUR INTEREST AHEAD OF THE RICH AND POWERFUL. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. IAV ENLISTED IN THE ARMY NATION GUARD AFTER 9/11 SO I COULD GO AFTER THOSE WHO ATTACKED US ON THAT DAY. I STILLWH SERVE AS A MAJOR. SERVED OVER 16 YEARS. AND IN CONGRESS I SERVED ON THE FOREIGNED AFFAIRS AND ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE FOR OVER SIX YEARS. I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AS WELL AS THE HIGH COST OF WAR AND FOR TOO LONG OUR LEADERS HAVE FAILED US, TAKING US FROM ONE WAR TO THE NEXT, LEADING US INTO A NEW COLD WAR COSTING US TRILLIONS OF OUR HARD-EARNED TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND COUNTLESS LIVES. THIS INSANITY MUST END. AS  IPRESIDENT, I WILL TAKE YOU HARD-EARNED TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND INVEST THOSE DOLLARS INTO SERVING YOUR NEEDS, THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE, A GREEN ECONOMY, GOOD-PAYING JOBS, PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SO MUCH MORE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE MAYOR OF THE BIGGEST CITY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE GREATEST GAP BETWEEN THE WEALTHY AND THE POOR. HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS INCOME INEQUALITY? &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN ADDRESSING INCOME INEQUALITY IN NEW YORK CITYNE B RAISING WAGES, BENEFITS, PUTTING MONEY BACKG  IN THE HANDS OF WORKING PEOPLE, $15 MINIMUM WAGE, PRE-K FOR ALL, THINGS THAT ARERK MAKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE. WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS THAT BATTLE FOR THEST HEART AND SOULF OUR PARTY. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PARTY OF WORKINGOS PEOPLE. YES, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR 70% TAX RATE ON THE WEALTHY, YES WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR FREE PUBLIC COLLEGE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BREAK UP BIG CORPORATIONS WHEN THEY'RE NOT SERVING OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TO BE STRONG ANDTO BOLD AND PROGRESSI AND IN NEW YORK WE'VE PROVEN THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT, WE CAN PUT MONEY BACK IN THE HANDS OF WORKING PEOPLE. AND EVERY TIME YOU TALK ABOUT INVESTING INE  PEOPLE AND THEIR COMMUNITIES, YOU HEAR FOLKS SAY, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY. WHAT I SAY, THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY IN THIS WORLD, IN THIS COUNTRY, IT'S JUST IN THE WRONG HANDS. WE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO FIX THAT [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; DO YOU AGREE? &gt;&gt; I THINK WE NEED TO DO REAL THINGS TO HELP AMERICAN WORKERS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT ALL OF US HERE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS A LIVING WAGE. AND I'VE CALLED FOR A DOUBLING OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. THAT WILL CREATE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE A LIVING WAGE. THEN WE GOT TO FIX OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. IT'S NOTRI DELIVERING THE RESUL OUR KIDS NEED NOR IS COLLEGE AND POSTHIGH SCHOOL CAREER AND TECHNICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS DOINGG THAT. I'M VERY DIFFERENT THAN EVERYONE ELSE HERE ON THE STAGE. PRIOR TOVE BEING IN CONGRESS, I WAS AN ENTREPRENEUR. I STARTED TWO BUSINESSES. I CREATED THOUSANDS OF JOBS. I SPENT MY WHOLE CAREER HELPING SMALL TOR  MID SIZE BUSINESSES L OVER THE COUNTRY. 5,000 OF THEM I SUPPORTED. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION GAVE ME AN AWARD FOR LENDING TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I KNOW HOW TO CREATE JOBS. WE NEED A SHORT TERM STRATEGY WHICH IS TO PUT MONEY IN THE POCKETS OFAX WORKERS, CREATE PA FAMILY LEAVE AND A LONG-TERM STRATEGY TOTE MAKE SURE THIS COUNTRY ISIS COMPETITIVE AND CREATING T JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY &gt;&gt; HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS INCOME INEQUALITY? &gt;&gt; I THINK PLANS ARE I GREAT, B I'M A GOVERNOR AND WE GOT TO REALIZE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT US THE WEEKEND, UNIONS, ARE GOING TO BRING US A LONG OVERDUE RAISE IN AMERICA. I'VE GOT F A PLAN TO REINVIGORA COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. I MARKED WITH THE FOLKS, IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT THE CEO OF McDONALDS MAKES 2,100 TIMES MORE THANAN EMPLOYEES. DONALD TRUMP IJOS SIMPLY WRONG. HE SAYS WINDND TURBINES CAUSE CANCER, WE KNOW THEY CAUSE JOBS. AND WE KNOW THAT WE CAN PUT MILLIONS OFTH PEOPLE TO WORK IN THE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS OF THE FUTURE. CARPENTERS,. MACHINISTS, WE'RE DOING IT IN MY STATE TODAY. AND THEN WE CAN DO WHAT AMERICA ALWAYS DOES, LEAD THE WORLD AND PUT PEOPLE TO WORK. &gt;&gt; PROMISED OF MANUFACTURING JOBS, WE'RE ALL COMING BACK TO PLACES LIKE YOUR HOME STATE OF OHIO. CAN YOU MAKE THAT SAME PROMISE? &gt;&gt; YES, I BELIEVE YOU CAN. BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID, DON'T SELL YOUR HOUSE AND HIS ADMINISTRATION JUST IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE LOST 4,000 JOBS AT A GENERAL MOTORS FACILITY THAT RIPPLED THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY, GENERAL MOTORS GOT A TAX CUT AND A BAILOUT AND THEN THEY HAVE THE AUDACITY TO MOVE A NEW CAR THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE TO MEXICO. I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE TO UNBOLT MACHINES FROM THE FACTORY FLOOR, PUT IT IN A BOX AND SHIP IT TO CHINA. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON 40 YEARS. THIS IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE BOTTOM 60% HAVEN'T SEEN A RAISE SINCE 1980. THE TOP 1% CONTROL 90% OF THE WEALTH. WE NEED A POLICY SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DOMINATE BUILDING ELECTRIC VEHICLES. I WANT HALF OF THEM MADE IN THE UNIT STATES. I WANT TO DOMINATE THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; SENATOR WARREN, ARE THESE JOBS COMING BACK? &gt;&gt; WE'VE HAD AN INDUSTRIAL POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR DECADES. IT'S BASICALLY BEEN LET GIANT CORPORATIONS DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO THE. THEY HAVE ONE LOYALTY, AND THAT IS TO PROFIT. IF THEY CAN SAVE A NICKEL BY MOVING A JOB TO MEXICO, ASIA OR CANADA, THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT. HERE'S WHAT I PROPOSE, START WITH A PLACE WHERE THERE'S REAL NEED. THERE'S GOING TO BE A WORLDWIDE NEED FOR GREEN TECHNOLOGY, WAYS TO CLEAN UP THE AIR AND WATER AND WE CAN BE THE ONES TO PROVIDE THAT. WE NEED TO GO TENFOLD IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON GREEN ENERGY GOING FORWARD AND THEN WE NEED TO SAY ANY CORPORATION CAN COME AND USE THAT RESEARCH, THEY CAN MAKE ALL KINDS OF PRODUCTS FROM IT, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE MANUFACTURED RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THEN WE HAVE TO DOUBLE DOWN AND SELL IT AROUND THE WORLD. THERE'S A $23 TRILLION MARKET COMING FOR GREEN PRODUCTS. WE SHOULD BE THE LEADERS AND THE OWNERS AND WE SHOULD HAVE THAT 1.2 MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS HERE IN THE AMERICA. WE CAN DO THIS. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE RIGHT NOW . MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER. WHO HERE WOULD ABOLISH THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IN FAVOR OF A GOVERNMENT-RUN PLAN? JUST A SHOW OF HANDS. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. WELL, SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, LET ME PUT THE QUESTION TO YOU. YOU'RE ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO KEEP PRIVATE INSURANCE. WHY IS AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH BETTER THAN A SWEEPING OVERALL APPROACH? &gt;&gt; I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING BARACK OBAMA WANTED TO DO WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. LET ME GO ON BEYOND THAT, THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE AND THAT'S PHARMACEUTICALS. THE PRESIDENT WENT ON TV ON FOX AND SAID THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH HE WILL BRING DOWN PRICES. INSTEAD HE GAVE A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR IN GIVE AWAYS TO THE PHARMA COMPANIES. FOR THE REST OF US, THE REST OF AMERICA, THAT'S WHAT WE CALL AT HOME, ALL FOAM AND NO BEER. WE GOT NOTHING OUT OF IT. AND SO MY PROPOSAL IS, TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT PHARMA, TO ALLOW NEGOTIATION UNDER MEDICARE, TO BRING YOU LESS EXPENSIVE DRUGS. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. SENATOR WARREN, YOU SIGNED ONTO BERNIE SANDERS MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN. IT WOULD PUT EVERYBODY ON MEDICARE AND THEN ELIMINATE PRIVATE PLANS THAT OFFER SIMILAR COVERAGE. IS THAT THE PLAN OR PATH THAT YOU WOULD PURSUE AS PRESIDENT? &gt;&gt; YES. I'M WITH BERNIE ON MEDICARE FOR ALL AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY. I SPENT A BIG CHUNK OF LIFE STUDYING WHY FAMILIES GO BROKE. AND ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE REASONS IS THE COST OF HEALTH CARE, MEDICAL BILLS, AND THAT'S NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE INSURANCE, IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE. LOOK AT THE BUSINESS MODEL OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY. IT'S TO BRING IN AS MANY DOLLARS AS THEY CAN IN PREMIUMS AND TO PAY OUT AS FEW DOLLARS AS POSSIBLE FOR YOUR HEALTH CARE. THAT LEAVES FAMILIES WITH RISING PREMIUMS, RISING CO-PAYS AND FIGHTING WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES TO TRY TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEIR DOCTORS SAY THAT THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN NEED. MEDICARE FOR ALL SOLVES THAT PROBLEM. AND I UNDERSTAND, THERE ARE A LOT OF POLITICIANS WHO SAY, OH, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE, WE CAN'T DO IT. WE HAVE A LOT OF POLITICAL REASONS FOR THIS. WHAT THEY'RE REALLY TELLING YOU IS THEY DON'T WANT TO FIGHT FOR IT. HEALTH CARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. AND I WILL FIGHT FOR BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU RAN FOR SENATE, YOU ALSO PRAISED THE BILL THAT WOULD REPLACE PRIVATE INSURANCE. THIS YEAR YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NO LONGER SURE. &gt;&gt; MY GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN IS WELL ENOUGH TO LIVE TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEALTH CARE. IN TEXAS I MET A YOUNG MAN, 27 YEARS OLD, TOLD ME THAT HE HAS BEEN TO A DOCTOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE, AND HE WAS TOLD HE HAD DIABETES, AND HE WAS TOLD UNTREATED BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH CARE, HE'LL BE DEAD BEFORE THE AGE OF 40. GETTING TO GUARANTEED HIGH-QUALITY HEALTH CARE HAS TO BE OUR GOAL. THE ABILITY TO AFFORD YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS, THE ABILITY TO SEE A MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THE SINGLE LARGEST PROVIDER OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS THE COUNTY JAIL. HEALTH CARE HAS TO MEAN THAT EVERY WOMAN CAN MEAN HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY AND HAS ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT MAKES THAT POSSIBLE. OUR PLAN SAYS IF YOU'RE UNINSURED, WE ENROLL IN YOU IN MEDICARE, BUT IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF A UNION THAT NEGOTIATED FOR A HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT LIKES, YOU'RE ABLE TO KEEP IT, WE PRESERVE CHOICE. &gt;&gt; TIME IS UP. I DO WANT TO ASK A FOLLOWUP ON THIS. WOULD YOU REPLACE PRIVATE INSURANCE? &gt;&gt; NO. I THINK THE CHOICE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR -- &gt;&gt; PRIVATE INSURANCE IS NOT WORKING FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CO-PAYS, THE DEDUCTIBLES, THE PREMIUMS, IT'S NOT WORKING. HOW CAN YOU DEFEND -- &gt;&gt; FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT WORKING, THEY CAN CHOOSE MEDICARE. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING IT'S NOT WORKING FOR PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE ABLE TO KEEP THEM. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT A HUNDRED MILLION AMERICAS, I THINK WE SHOULD BE THE PARTY THAT KEEPS WHAT'S WORKING AND FIXES WHAT'S BROKEN. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE? EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY HEALTH CARE AS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT FOR FREE, BUT WE SHOULD GIVE THEM THE ALSO TO BUY PRIVATE INSURANCE. WHY DO WE HAVE TO STAND FOR TAKING SOMETHING AWAY FROM PEOPLE. IF YOU GO TO EVERY HOSPITAL IN THIS COUNTRY AND YOU ASK THEM ONE QUESTION WHICH IS HOW WOULD IT HAVE BEEN FOR YOU LAST YEAR IF EVERY ONE OF YOUR BILLS WERE PAID AT THE MEDICARE RATE, EVERY HOSPITAL ADMINISTER SAID THEY WOULD CLOSE. AND A MEDICARE FOR ALL BILL, REQUIRES PAYMENTS TO STAY AT CURRENT MEDICARE RATES. WE'RE SUPPORTING A BILL THAT WILL HAVE EVERY HOSPITAL CLOSE. MY DAD WAS A UNION ELECTRICIAN, HE LOVED THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY GAVE HIM. AND I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT MY DAD FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. HE WOULD SAY, GOOD JOB, JOHN, FOR GETTING HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICA. BUT WHY ARE YOU TAKING MY HEALTH CARE AWAY. &gt;&gt; I'M FASCINATED -- CONGRESSWOMAN GABBARD? &gt;&gt; I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THE WRONG WAY. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS OUR OBJECTIVE, MAKING SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN IS ABLE TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. I BELIEVE MEDICARE FOR ALL IS THE WAY TO DO THAT. I THINK THAT EMPLOYERS WILL RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH MONEY WILL BE SAVED BY SUPPORTING A MEDICARE FOR ALL PROGRAM. A PROGRAM THAT WILL REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, REDUCE THE BUREAUCRATIC COST AND IS MAKE SURE EVERYONE GETS THE QUALITY HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WHO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS SOME FORM OF A ROLE OF PRIVATE INSURANCE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO LOOK AT, TAKING THE BEST OF THESE IDEAS, BUT MAKING SURE THAT NO SICK AMERICAN GOES WITHOUT GETTING THE CARE THAT THEY NEED REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH OR LITTLE MONEY THEY HAVE IN THEIR POCKET. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; SENATOR BOOKER, EXPLAIN TO ME WHERE YOU ARE. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE. TELL US WHERE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE, IT'S AN EDUCATION ISSUE, KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE AREN'T GOING TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL. IT'S AN ISSUE FOR JOBS AND EMPLOYMENT, BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE GOOD HEALTH CARE, DO NOT SUCCEED AT WORK. IT'S EVEN A RETIREMENT ISSUE BECAUSE AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE A LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCY BECAUSE OF POOR HEALTH CARE. WHERE I STAND IS VERY CLEAR, HEALTH CARE IS NOT JUST A HUMAN RIGHT, IT SHOULD BE AN AMERICAN RIGHT. AND I BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE IS MEDICARE FOR ALL. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I'M NOT GOING TO WAIT. WE HAVE TO DO THE THINGS IMMEDIATELY THAT ARE GOING TO PROVIDE BETTER CARE AND ON THIS DEBATE, I'M SORRY, THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE PROFITEERING OFF OF THE PAIN OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA. INSURERS CHARGE 15%, WHILE MEDICARE OVERHEAD IS ONLY AT 2%. WE CAN DO THIS BETTER AND EVERY SINGLE DAY I WILL BE FIGHTING TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE ACCESS UNTIL WE GET TO MY GOAL WHICH IS EVERY AMERICAN HAVING HEALTH CARE. &gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO ANSWER -- &gt;&gt; TIME IS UP. &gt;&gt; THE INSURANCE COMPANIES LAST YEAR ALONE, SUCKED $23 BILLION IN PROFITS OUT OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, AND THAT DOESN'T COUNT THE MONEY THAT WAS PAID TO EXECUTIVES, THE MONEY THAT WAS SPENT LOBBYING WASHINGTON. WE HAVE A GIANT INDUSTRY THAT WANTS OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO STAY THE WAY IT IS. IT'S NOT WORKING FOR FAMILIES, BUT IT'S WORKING FOR -- &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR US TO MAKE FAMILIES COME FIRST. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD NOT BE AN OPTION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR ANY INSURANCE COMPANY TO DENY A WOMAN COVERAGE FOR THEIR EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHT OF CHOICE. AND I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE HERE WHO HAS PASSED A LAW PROTECTING A WOMEN'S RIGHT TO HEALTH INSURANCE AND I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO'S PASSED A PUBLIC OPTION. AND I RESPECT EVERYBODY'S GOALS AND PLANS HERE. BUT WE HAVE ONE CANDIDATE THAT'S ADVANCED THE BALL, AND WE GOT TO HAVE ACCESS FOR EVERYONE. &gt;&gt; TIME IS UP. &gt;&gt; SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, I WANT TO -- &gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO SAY THERE'S THREE WOMEN UP HERE WHO HAVE FOUGHT PRETTY HARD FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. I WILL START WITH THAT. I THINK WE SHARE THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND THE IDEA I PUT OUT THERE, THE PUBLIC OPTION, WHICH THE GOVERNOR WAS TALKING ABOUT, THIS IDEA THAT YOU USE MEDICARE OR MEDICAID, WITHOUT ANY INSURANCE COMPANIES INVOLVED, AND THE ESTIMATES ARE 13 MILLION PEOPLE WOULD SEE A REDUCTION IN THEIR PREMIUMS, 12 MORE MILLION PEOPLE WOULD GET COVERAGE. I THINK IT IS A BEGINNING IN THE WAY YOU START AND THE WAY YOU MOVE TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. &gt;&gt; SECRETARY CASTRO, THIS ONE IS FOR YOU, ALL OF YOU ON STAGE SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO AN ABORTION, A RIGHT TO A GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE OPTION, WOULD YOU PLAN COVER ABORTION? &gt;&gt; YES, IT WOULD. I BELIEVE IN REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT JUSTICE BECAUSE A WOMAN OR -- LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET SOMEONE IN THE TRANS COMMUNITY, IS POOR DOESN'T MEAN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE THAT RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AND SO I ABSOLUTELY WOULD COVER THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. MORE THAN THAT, EVERYBODY IN THIS CROWD AND WATCHING AT HOME KNOWS THAT IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY, A PERSON'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS UNDER ASSAULT IN PLACES LIKE MISSOURI, IN ALABAMA, IN GEORGIA. I WOULD APPOINT JUDGES TO THE FEDERAL BENCH THAT UNDERSTAND THE PRECEDENT OF ROE V. WADE AND RESPECT IT AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, MAKE SURE WE FIGHT HARD AS WE TRANSITION OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO ONE WHERE EVERYBODY CAN GET AND EXERCISE THAT RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU PUT ANY LIMITS ON ABORTION? &gt;&gt; I WOULD MAKE CERTAIN THAT EVERY WOMAN HAS ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THAT INCLUDES BIRTH CONTROL, ABORTION, IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FOR A WOMAN. AND I WANT TO ADD ON THAT, IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR US TO EXPECT THE COURTS TO PROTECT US. 47 YEARS AGO ROE V. WADE WAS DECIDED AND WE'VE ALL LOOKED TO THE COURTS ALL THAT TIME AS STATE AFTER STATE HAS UNDERMINED ROE, HAS PUT IN EXCEPTIONS, HAS COME RIGHT UP TO THE EDGE OF TAKING AWAY -- &gt;&gt; YOUR TIME IS UP, SENATOR. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE AN AMERICA WHERE MOST PEOPLE SUPPORT ROE V. WADE. WE NEED TO MAKE THAT A FEDERAL LAW. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO COME BACK ON THE DISCUSSION WE WERE HAVING ABOUT HEALTH AND THE OPIOID CRISIS. YOU REPRESENT A STATE WHERE 14 OF THE 20 LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE BASED. SHOULD PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE THESE DRUGS BE HELD CRIMINALLY LIABLE FOR WHAT THEY DO? &gt;&gt; THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE HELD CRIMINALLY LIABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE LIABLE AND RESPONSIBLE. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I SAID I WOULD NOT TAKE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PHARMA COMPANIES, NOT TAKE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM CORPORATE PACS BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THIS PROBLEM. AND THIS OPIOID ADDICTION IN OUR COUNTRY, WE IN CITIES LIKE MINE HAVE BEEN SEEING HOW WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ARREST OUR WAY OUT OF ADDICTION FOR TOO LONG. IT'S TIME THAT WE HAVE A NATIONAL URGENCY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AND MAKE THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE WORKING TO ACTUALLY BE THE LAW OF OUR LAND AND MAKE THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE HELP THEM PAY FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH IT? &gt;&gt; TONIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU HAVE 2.3 MILLION FELLOW AMERICANS BEHIND BARS. IT'S THE LARGEST PRISON POPULATION ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. MANY ARE THERE FOR NONVIOLENT DRUG CRIMES AT A TIME WHERE MOST OF THE STATES HAVE LEGALIZED IT OR DECRIMINALIZED IT. AND DESPITE WHAT PURDUE PHARMA HAS DONE, THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACT WITH IMPUNITY AND PAY NO CONSEQUENCES. THIS CRISIS WILL CONTINUE. IN MY ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL HOLD THEM TO ACCOUNT. MAKE SURE THEY PAY A PRICE AND WE WILL HELP THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THIS, GET THEM TREATMENT AND LONG-TERM HEALTH CARE. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE FROM MIAMI, AFTER THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO TURN TO AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS ESPECIALLY THIS WEEK. THERE ARE UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN BEING HELD ALONE IN DETENTION. EVEN AS CLOSE AS HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA. FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND CHILDREN ARE DYING WHILE TRYING TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE SAW THAT IMAGE TODAY THAT BROKE OUR HEARTS AND THEY HAD NAMES. THEY DIED TRYING TO CROSS THE RIVER TO ASK FOR ASYLUM IN THIS COUNTRY. MORE THAN 130,000 MIGRANTS WERE APPREHENDED AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT TODAY, WHAT WOULD YOU SPECIFICALLY DO? &gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M VERY PROUD THAT IN APRIL I BECAME THE FIRST CANDIDATE TO PUT FORWARD A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION PLAN AND WE SAW THOSE IMAGES, WATCHING THAT IMAGE, IT'S HEARTBREAKING, IT SHOULD ALSO PISS US ALL OFF. IF I WERE PRESIDENT TODAY, I WOULD SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WOULD GET RID OF TRUMP'S ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY, THE REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY AND THE METERING POLICY. THE METERING POLICY IS BASICALLY WHAT PROMPTED THE TWO TO MAKE THAT RISKY SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER. THEY HAD BEEN PLAYING GAMES WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO SEEK ASYLUM. THEY WENT TO A PORT OF ENTRY AND THEN THEY WERE DENIED THE ABILITY TO MAKE AN ASYLUM PLAN, SO THEY TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER AND THEY DIED BECAUSE OF THAT. ON DAY ONE, I WOULD DO THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WOULD ADDRESS METERING AND I WOULD FOLLOW THAT UP IN MY FIRST HUNDRED DAYS IN IMMIGRATION REFORM, THAT WOULD PUT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, AS LONG AS THEY HAVEN'T COMMITTED A SERIOUS CRIME, ON A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. AND WE NEED A PLAN TO PEOPLE CAN FIND OPPORTUNITY AT HOME INSTEAD OF COMING TO THE UNITED STATES TO SEEK IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON DAY ONE? AND THIS IS A SITUATION THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WOULD INHERIT? [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] &gt;&gt; ON DAY ONE, I WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE END THE ICE POLICY AND THE CUSTOMS AND BORDER POLICIES THAT ARE VIOLATING THE HUMAN RIGHTS. WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THIS COUNTRY, THEY DO NOT LEAVE THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS AT THE BORDER. NUMBER TWO, I WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE REINSTATE DACA, PATHWAYS TO CITIZENSHIP AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE CAN STAY AND REMAIN HERE. AND FINALLY, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT MADE OSCAR AND HIS DAUGHTER COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE, MAKING MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN THE NORTHERN TRIANGLE. WE CANNOT SURRENDER OUR VALUES AND THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET BORDER SECURITY. WE WILL LOSE SECURITY AND OUR VALUES. WE MUST FIGHT FOR BOTH. &gt;&gt; IF I MIGHT, VERY BRIEFLY, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT, MY PLAN -- AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT SENATOR BOOKER, WARREN, AND GOVERNOR INSLEE AGREE WITH ME ON THIS, MY PLAN ALSO INCLUDES OF GETTING RID OF SECTION 1325, TO GO BACK TO THE WAY WE USED TO TREAT THIS, NOT TO CRIMINALIZE DESPERATION. THEY USE THAT LAW TO JUSTIFY UNDER THE LAW SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES. AND SO I WANT TO CHALLENGE EVERY SINGLE CANDIDATE ON THIS STAGE TO SUPPORT THE REPEAL. &gt;&gt; I AGREE WITH HIM ON THIS ISSUE, BUT FOLKS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEPARATION FROM CHILDREN AND FAMILIES HAPPENS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I.C.E. IS RIPPING CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS AND ARE CREATING FEAR IN CITIES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WHERE PARENTS ARE AFRAID TO GO TO WORK AND DROP THEIR CHILDREN OFF AT SCHOOL. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LINE HERE, THOSE TRAGIC -- THAT TRAGIC PHOTO OF THOSE PARENTS, THAT CHILD, AND I'M SAYING THIS AS A FATHER, EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD FEEL THAT IN THEIR HEART. EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD SAY THAT IS NOT AMERICA. WE'RE NOT BEING HONEST ABOUT THE DIVISION IN THIS COUNTRY. THE WAY THAT CITIZENS HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IMMIGRANTS HAVE CREATED THEIR PAIN AND CHALLENGE. THE IMMIGRANTS DIDN'T DO THAT TO YOU. THE BIG CORPORATIONS DID THAT TO YOU. THE 1% DID THAT TO YOU. WE NEED TO BE THE PARTY OF WORKING PEOPLE AND THAT INCLUDES THE PARTY OF IMMIGRANTS, BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO TELL WORKING PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO ARE WORKING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THEIR SIDE AGAINST BIG CORPORATIONS WHO CREATED THIS MESS AND REMIND PEOPLE, IF WE DON'T CHANGE THIS, WE WON'T GET ALL OF THESE REFORMS. &gt;&gt;. [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD YOU DO, CONGRESSMAN, DAY ONE, AT THE WHITE HOUSE? [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] &gt;&gt; WE WOULD NOT TURN THEM BACK. WE WOULD NOT BUILD WALLS, WE WOULD NOT PUT KIDS IN CAGES. IN FACT WE WOULD SPARE NO EXPENSE -- &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT PENALIZING -- &gt;&gt; YOU WOULD MAKE SURE -- &gt;&gt; LET HIM FINISH. &gt;&gt; WE WOULD NOT DETAIN ANY FAMILIES FLEEING VIOLENCE. WE WOULD IMPLEMENT A FAMILY CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM SO THEY COULD BE CARED FOR IN THE COMMUNITY AT A FRACTION OF THE COST AND WE WOULD REWRITE OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS IN OUR OWN IMAGE, FREE DREAMERS FOREVER FROM ANY DEPORTATION BY MAKING THEM CITIZENS, INVEST IN CENTRAL AMERICA SO THERE'S NO REASON TO MAKE THAT JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; LET'S BE VERY CLEAR, THE REASON THAT THEY'RE SEPARATING THESE LITTLE CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES IS THAT THEY'RE USING SECTION 1325 OF THAT ACT WHICH CRIMINALIZES COMING ACROSS THE BORDER TO INCARCERATE THE PARENTS AND SEPARATE THEM. SOME OF US ON THIS STAGE HAVE CALLED TO END THAT SECTION, TO TERMINATE IT. SOME, LIKE CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE HAVE NOT, AND I WANT TO CHALLENGE ALL OF THE CANDIDATES TO DO THAT. &gt;&gt; I JUST THINK IT'S A MISTAKE. AND I THINK THAT IF YOU TRULY WANT TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM, THAT WE GOT TO REPEAL THAT SECTION. IF NOT, THEN IT MIGHT -- &gt;&gt; LET ME RESPOND TO THIS. AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, I HELPED INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ENSURE WE DON'T CRIMINALIZE THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING ASYLUM. &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE LOOKING AT JUST ONE SMALL PART OF THIS. I'M TALKING ABOUT A COMPREHENSIVE REWRITE OF OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. IF WE DO THAT -- &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT TRUE. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE COMING ARE NOT SEEKING ASYLUM. A LOT OF THEM ARE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. AND YOU SAID RECENTLY THAT THE REASON YOU DIDN'T WANT TO REPEAL THE SECTION WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND DRUG TRAFFICKING. SECTION 18 -- TITLE 18 OF THE U.S. CODE, TITLE 21, 22 ALREADY COVER THE -- &gt;&gt; IF YOU DID YOUR HOMEWORK -- &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD AND COULD BE TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME AND WE WILL FOR A LONG TIME -- &gt;&gt; CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF WHY PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE? &gt;&gt; SAVANNAH, IT'S JUST -- WE COULD GO ON -- &gt;&gt; WE REALLY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHY THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING TO OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; LET'S CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION. SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT SECRETARY CASTRO JUST SAID. HE WANTS TO NO LONGER HAVE IT BE A CRIME TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER. DO YOU SUPPORT THAT? DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE A CIVIL OFFENSE ONLY AND IF SO, DO YOU WORRY ABOUT POTENTIALLY INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO COME HERE? &gt;&gt; IMMIGRANTS, THEY DO NOT DIMINISH AMERICA, THEY ARE AMERICA. AND I AM HAPPY TO LOOK AT HIS PROPOSAL, BUT I DO THINK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE PROVISIONS IN PLACE THAT ALLOW YOU TO GO AFTER TRAFFICKERS AND ALLOW YOU TO GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO ARE VIOLATING THE LAW. WHAT I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD STEP BACK AND TALK ABOUT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE HERE. AND THAT IS THAT OUR COUNTRIES ARE HEADED UP BY PEOPLE WHO CAME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. WE HAVE A SITUATION RIGHT NOW WHERE WE NEED WORKERS IN OUR FIELDS AND IN OUR FACTORIES, WE NEED THEM TO START SMALL BUSINESSES, WE NEED THEIR IDEAS. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS LITERALLY GONE BACKWARDS AT A TIME WHERE OUR ECONOMY NEEDS IMMIGRANTS. AND SO MY PROPOSAL IS TO LOOK AT THAT 2013 BILL THAT PASSED THE SENATE WITH REPUBLICAN SUPPORT, TO UPGRADE THAT BILL, TO MAKE IT AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE, TO GET IT DONE. IT BRINGS THE DEBT DOWN BY $158 BILLION. IT GIVES A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN BECOME CITIZENS AND IT WILL BE SO MUCH BETTER FOR OUR ECONOMY IN AMERICA. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TIME, THANK YOU. SHOULD IT BE A CRIME TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER OR SHOULD IT BE A CIVIL OFFENSE ONLY? &gt;&gt; I AGREE WITH SECRETARY CASTRO. I THINK THERE ARE OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE LAW THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO PROSECUTE FOR PEOPLE COMING OVER HERE IF THEY'RE DEALING DRUGS. THERE'S NO NEED TO REPEAT IT. I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS FATHER WHO GOT KILLED WITH HIS DAUGHTER, AND THE ISSUES HERE, THE WAY THESE KIDS ARE BEING TREATED, IF YOU GO TO GUANTANAMO BAY, THERE ARE TERRORISTS THAT ARE HELD THAT GET BETTER HEALTH CARE THAN THOSE KIDS WHO TRIED TO CROSS THE BORDER IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT NEEDS TO STOP. AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY ASK DOCTORS AND NURSES TO GO IMMEDIATELY DOWN TO THE BORDER AND START TAKING CARE OF THESE KIDS. WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ARE WE RUNNING HERE WHERE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO'S SO FOCUSED ON HATE AND FEAR AND DIVISION AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW, THE END RESULT IS NOW HE'S GOT KIDS LAYING IN THEIR OWN SNOT WITH THREE-WEEK OLD DIAPERS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED. THAT IS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; A LOT OF -- IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT ON DAY ONE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU WILL HAVE FAMILIES HERE, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'LL DO IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS ABOUT LEGISLATION. WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THESE FAMILIES? HOW WILL YOU CARE WITH THEM? &gt;&gt; THIS IS RELATED AND BRIEF POINT. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT WE HAVE THE POWER TO BETTER DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM THROUGH THE CIVIL PROCESS THAN THE CRIMINAL PROCESS. I HAVE BEEN TO SOME OF THE LARGEST PRIVATE PRISONS. OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE SO MANY MISTAKES BY CRIMINALIZING THINGS WHETHER IT'S IMMIGRATION, WHETHER IT'S ADDICTION, WE KNOW THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS. THERE'S A HUMANE WAY THAT AFFIRMS HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DIGNITY. DONALD TRUMP ISN'T SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. WE SOLVED THIS PROBLEM BY MAKING INVESTMENTS IN THE NORTHERN TRIANGLE TO STOP THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE BEING DRIVEN HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE CANNOT SACRIFICE OUR VALUES, IDEALS AS A NATION FOR BORDER SECURITY. WE CAN HAVE BOTH BY DOING THIS THE RIGHT WAY. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. LET ME GO TOP GOVERNOR INSLEE ON THIS. WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON DAY ONE? I HAVE YET TO HEAR AN ANSWER FROM ANYONE ON THIS STAGE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO REASON FOR THE DETENTION OF THESE CHILDREN. THEY SHOULD BE RELEASED PENDING THEIR HEARINGS AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A HEARING AND THE LAW SHOULD BE FOLLOWED. AND WE SHOULD DO WHAT WE'RE DOING TO WASHINGTON STATE. I'M PROUD THAT WE PASSED A LAW THAT PREVENTS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM BEING TURNED INTO MINI I.C.E. AGENTS. I'M PROUD TO BE THE FIRST GOVERNOR TO STAND UP TO DONALD TRUMP'S MUSLIM BAN. I'M PROUD TO BE A PERSON WHO'S NOT ONLY TALKED ABOUT DREAMERS, BUT BEING ONE OF THE FIRST TO MAKE SURE THEY GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION, SO THEY CAN REALIZE THEIR DREAMS. THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST INSPIRATIONAL PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. DONALD TRUMP THE OTHER DAY TRIED TO THREATEN ME TO TELL ME THAT HE WOULD SEND REFUGEES IN WASHINGTON STATE IF WE PASSED THE LAW THAT I PASSED AND I TOLD HIM THAT'S NOT A THREAT AT ALL. WE WELCOME REFUGEES INTO OUR STATE. WE RECOGNIZE DIVERSITY AS A STRENGTH. THIS IS HOW WE BUILT AMERICA. THAT TRADITION IS GOING TO CONTINUE IF I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO SWITCH TO ANOTHER TOPIC -- &gt;&gt; MY GRANDFATHER WAS ACTUALLY SEPARATED FROM HIS FAMILY -- &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IRAN RIGHT NOW. TANKERS HAVE BEEN ATTACKED, A U.S. DRONE HAS BEEN SHOT DOWN. THERE HAVE BEEN THREATS ISSUED BY BOTH THE U.S. AND IRANIAN LEADERSHIP. I WOULD LIKE, IF YOU CAN, JUST FOR A MOMENT, PUT ASIDE WHY YOU THINK WE MAY HAVE GOTTEN HERE, BUT I WANT TO KNOW, HOW DO WE DIAL IT BACK? BY A SHOW OF HANDS, WHO WOULD SIGN ONTO THE NUCLEAR DEAL. &gt;&gt; FIRST AND FOREMOST IT WAS A MISTAKE TO PULL OUT OF THAT DEAL. AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE SEEING THE HOSTILITY NOW IS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS MARCHING UP TO A FAR MORE DANGERS SITUATION. HE TOOK US OUT OF A DEAL THAT GAVE US TRANSPARENCY INTO THEIR PROGRAM AND NOW WE SEE IRAN THREATENING TO GO FURTHER AND BEING PULLED FURTHER INTO THIS CRISIS. WE NEED TO RENEGOTIATE AND GET BACK INTO A DEAL BUT I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE A PRIMARY PLATFORM TO SAY I'M GOING TO REJOIN THAT DEAL BECAUSE WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I'M GOING TO DO THE BEST I CAN TO SECURE THIS COUNTRY AND THAT REGION AND MAKE SURE THAT IF I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE A BETTER DEAL, I'M GOING TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, YOU SAID YOU SHOULD NEGOTIATE YOURSELF BACK INTO THE IRANIAN AGREEMENT. CAN YOU ARGUE THAT THAT NUCLEAR PACT WAS A GOOD DEAL? &gt;&gt; IT WAS IMPERFECT, BUT IT WAS A GOOD DEAL FOR THAT MOMENT. I WOULD HAVE WORKED TO GET LONGER SUNSET PERIODS, AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD NEGOTIATE AFTER WE GET BACK IN THE DEAL. BUT THE POINT IS, DONALD TRUMP TOLD US WHEN WE GOT OUT OF IT, HE WAS GOING TO GIVE US A BETTER DEAL, AND NOW WE ARE A MONTH AWAY FROM THE IRANIANS WHO CLAIM NOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BLOW THE CAP ON ENRICHING URANIUM. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. HE'S MADE US LESS SAFE THAN WE WERE THAN BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT. WE NEED TO STAND WITH OUR ALLIES AND NOT GIVE AND IF THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY OF A CONFLICT, THAT HE COMES TO CONGRESS FOR AN AUTHORIZATION OF MILITARY FORCE. I WOULD DO THAT. AND THIS PRESIDENT IS LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE DAY TEN MINUTES AWAY FROM GOING TO WAR, ONE TWEET FROM GOING TO WAR, AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN CONDUCT FOREIGN POLICY IN OUR BATHROBE AT 5 IN THE MORNING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU INSIST, THOUGH, THAT IT ADDRESS IRAN'S SUPPORTIVE FOR HEZBOLLAH? &gt;&gt; LET'S DEAL WITH THE SITUATION WHERE WE ARE. WHERE THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS CABINET HAVE LED US TO THE BRINK OF WAR WITH IRAN. I SERVED IN THE WAR IN IRAQ AT THE HEIGHT OF THE WAR IN 2005, A WAR THAT TOOK OVER 4,000 OF MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN UNIFORMS' LIVES. THIS WAR WITH IRAN WOULD BE FAR MORE DEVASTATING THAN ANYTHING THAT WE EVER SAW IN IRAQ. IT WOULD TAKE MANY MORE LIVES, AND IT WOULDN'T BE JUST CONTAINED WITHIN IRAN. THIS WOULD TURN INTO A REGIONAL WAR. THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT EVERY ONE OF US, EVERY SINGLE AMERICA STAND UP AND SAY NO WAR WITH IRAN. WE NEED TO GET BACK INTO THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT AND WE NEED TO NEGOTIATE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT. IT WAS AN IMPERFECT DEAL. THERE ARE ISSUES LIKE THEIR MISSILE DEVELOPMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WE CAN DO BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY TO PREVENT IRAN FROM DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND PREVENTING US FROM GOING TO WAR. &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD YOUR RED LINE BE FOR MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAN? &gt;&gt; LOOK, OBVIOUSLY IF THERE AS AN ATTACK AGAINST TROOPS, THEN THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A RESPONSE. DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CABINET ARE CREATING A SITUATION THAT JUST A SPARK WOULD LIGHT OFF A WAR WITH IRAN WHICH IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO DEESCALATE TENSIONS. TRUMP NEEDS TO GET BACK INTO THE IRAN NUCAR DEAL AND PUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST. &gt;&gt; WE ARE OUT OF TIME. WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE -- WE'LL HAVE MORE. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR QUESTIONING NEXT. STICK AROUND. WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE WITH THE CANDIDATES JUST AHEAD. [ APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK TO THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN MIAMI. &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW LET'S TURN IT OVER TO CHUCK TODD AND RACHEL MADDOW. TAKE IT AWAY. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO START BY RECAPPING THE RULES, 20 CANDIDATES QUALIFIED FOR THIS DEBATE. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM 10 TONIGHT, 10 MORE TOMORROW. THE BREAKDOWN WAS SELECTED AT RANDOM. THE CANDIDATES WILL HAVE 60 SECONDS TO ANSWER, 30 SECONDS FOR A FOLLOWUP, AND WE WILL BE RUTHLESS IF NECESSARY. &gt;&gt; WE CAN DO THAT. HI, RACHEL. &gt;&gt; HI, CHUCK. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT GUNS AND CLIMATE AND A WHOLE LOT MORE IN THIS HOUR, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE FIELD, NOT EVERY PERSON WILL BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON EVERYTHING, BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THIS NEXT HOUR, WE WILL HEAR FROM EVERYONE, I PROMISE, EVERYBODY, AND WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH GUNS AND SENATOR WARREN I WANT TO START WITH YOU. WE ARE LESS THAN 50 MILES FROM PARKLAND, FLORIDA, WHERE 17 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN A SCHOOL SHOOTING LAST YEAR. WHERE THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT ACTIVISM ON GUN VIOLENCE, MANY OF YOU ARE CALLING FOR A REIMPLEMENTATION OF AN ASSAULTS BAN. BUT THERE WILL STILL BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF GUN IN THIS -- EVERYBODY'S MICS ARE ON. I THINK WE HAD A MIC ISSUE IN THE BACK. ALL RIGHT. SO THE QUESTION IS SIMPLY THIS, I APOLOGIZE YOU DIDN'T GET TO HEAR THIS. WE'RE NOT FAR FROM PARKLAND, FLORIDA. GUN ACTIVISM HAS BECOME A BIG PART OF HIGH SCHOOL LIFE. MANY OF YOU ARE CALLING FOR TIGHTER GUN RESTRICTIONS, SOME OF YOU ARE CALLING FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE, PERHAPS, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF GUNS STILL ON THE STREETS. IS THERE A ROLE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO PLAY -- IN ORDER TO GET THESE GUNS OFF THE STREETS? WE ARE -- &gt;&gt; IT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; WE ARE HEARING OUR COLLEAGUES' AUDIO. IF THE CONTROL ROOM COULD TURN OFF THE MICS. YEAH. IF THE CONTROL ROOM COULD TURN OFF THE MICS OF OUR PREVIOUS MODERATORS, WE WILL -- &gt;&gt; WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MODERATORS. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; GUESS WHAT, GUYS, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK. WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS TECHNICAL SITUATION FIXED. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. &gt;&gt; NEVER SAY THAT. &gt;&gt; NEVER SAY NEVER BUT WE WILL MARCH FORWARD HERE. AND I LEAN FORWARD HERE A LITTLE BIT. SENATOR WARREN WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE GUN QUESTION HERE. PARKLAND, FLORIDA. JUST NORTH OF HERE IN BROWARD COUNTY. AS YOU KNOW IT HAS CREATED A LOT OF TEENAGE ACTIVISM ON THE GUN ISSUE. IT HAS INSPIRED A LOT OF TO YOU COME OUT WITH MORE ROBUST PLANS TO DOO DEAL WITH GUN, INCLUDING ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN BUT EVEN IF ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THAT, WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF GUNS ALREADY OUT THERE AND DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE TO PLAY A ROLE IN DEALING WITH IT? &gt;&gt; SO, IN IN PERIOD OF TIME THAT I'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT I HAVE HAD MORE THAN 100 TOWNHALLS, TAKEN MORE THAN 2,000 UNFILTERED QUESTIONS. AND SINGLE HARDEST QUESTION I'VE GOTTEN I GOT FROM A LITTLE BOY AND ONE FROM A LITTLE GIRL. THAT IS TO SAY WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP US SAFE? THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS ADULTS. 7 CHILDREN WILL DIE TODAY FROM GUN VIOLENCE. CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS. AND NOT JUST IN MASS SHOOTINGS. THEY WILL DIE IN PLAYGROUND, PEOPLE'S BACK YARDS. GUN VIOLENCE IS A NATIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE NEED TO TREAT IT LIKE THAT. SO WHAT CAN WE DO? DO THE THINGS SENSIBLE. DO THE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. WE CAN BAN THE WEAPONS OF WAR. BUT WAS WE CAN ALSO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE RESEARCH AND FIND OUT WHAT REALLY WORKS. WHERE IT IS THAT WE CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCES AT THE MARGINS THAT WILL KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE. WE NEED TO TREAT THIS LIKE THE VIRUS THAT'S KILLING OUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T ADDRESS -- DO YOU THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO GO AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE GUNS OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO IS NEED TO TROO TREAT IT LIKE A SERIOUS RESEARCH PROBLEM WHICH WE HAVE NOT DONE. YOU KNOW, GUNS IN THE HANDS OF A COLLECTOR WHO HAS HAD THEM FOR DECADES PB, NEVER FIRED -- HE TAKES SAFETY SERIOUSLY. THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM GUNS THAT ARE SOLD AND TURNED OVER QUICKLY. WE CAN'T TREAT IN AS AN ACROSS THE BOARD PROBLEM. WE HAVE TO TREAT IT LIKE A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT NEEDS TO BRING DATA TO BEAR AND MEANS MAKING REAL CHANGE IN THE COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; WHETHER POLITICALLY POPULAR OR NOT. &gt;&gt; SENATOR. &gt;&gt; SAFER FOR OUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; SENATOR BOOKER YOU HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUYBACK PROGRAM IN YOUR PLAN. HOW IS THAT GOING TO WORK. &gt;&gt; WELL, FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY MY COLLEAGUE AND I HAVE BEEN BOTH HEARING THIS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. BUT WHAT'S WORSE I HEAR GUNSHOTS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE I HOPE I'M THE ONLY ONE ON THE PANEL WHO HAD SEVEN PEOPLE SHOT IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD LAST WEEK. SOMEONE I KNEW WAS KILLED WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE AT THE TOP OF MY BLOCK LAST YEAR. FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THIS IS NOT A POLICY ISSUE. THIS IS AN URGENCY. FOR THOSE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED IF YOU'RE TIRED OF LIVING IN A COUNTRY WHERE KIDS LEARN TO SCHOOL TO LEARN READING WRITING AND MATH AND HOW TO DEAL WITH ACTIVE SHOOTER IN THEIR SCHOOL. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'M TIRED OF. AND I'M TIRED OF HEARING PEOPLE ALL THEY HAVE TO OFFER IS THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. IN MY STATE PEOPLE SAY FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD. WE WILL FIND A WAY. THE REASON WE HAVE A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS WE LET THE CORPORATE GUN LOBBY FRAME IN DEBATE. IT IS TIME THAT WE HAVE BOLD ACTIONS AND A BOLD AGENDA. I WILL GET THAT GUN DSH DID AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLICY THIS IS PERSONAL. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR BOOKER. &gt;&gt; SENATOR KLOBUCHAR I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT SENATOR BOOK ARE MENTIONED, THE ACTIVE SHOOTER DRELS. THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS DON'T MAKE A COMPLETE NEWS CYCLE ANYMORE NO MATTER THE DEATH TOLL PROCESS. PARENTS ARE SO AFRAID AS KIDS GO TO SCHOOL THAT KIDS ARE CAUGHT UP IN THIS. NEXT TO NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN FLAL LAW TO AFFECT THE SCHOOL SHOOINGS. THIS A PROBLEM GETTING WORSE OVER THE LIFETIME SNS OR IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT THAT YOU REALLY THINK WOULD TURN IT AROUND? &gt;&gt; YEAH, RACHEL, I -- I'M THE DAD OF A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO IS HERE TONIGHT. AND THE WORST THING IS KNOWING THAT YOUR CHILD MIGHT BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN AT SCHOOL, A PLACE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE. THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS, NO, WE DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT. AND I BELIEVE THAT ON JANUARY 20th, 2021, AT 12:01 P.M. WE WILL HAVE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC HOUSE AND DEMOCRATIC SENATE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; AND THE ACTIVE THEISTS OF PARKLAND BOTH THEM AND THOSE WHO ARE RISEN UP ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND INSPIRED SO MANY. WE MAY NOT HAVE SEEN YET LEGISLATIVE ACTION, BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSER. THE HOUSE TOOK A VOTE. IN THE SENATE THE QUESTION IS IF THE DECISION IS BETWEEN 60 VOTES, A FILIBUSTER OR PASSING COMMON SENSE GUN REFORM. I'M CHATTANOOGA KMOOSING COMMON SENSE GUN REFORM WE'RE GETTING THAT DOWN DONE IN 2021. &gt;&gt; I HAVE SOMETHING TO. &gt;&gt; WE'LL GIVE YOU 30 SECONDS TO FOLLOW UP ON THE ANSWER FROM SECRETARY CASTRO CONGRESSMAN RYAN. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE SCHOOLS. THESE KIDS ARE TRAUMATIZED. I SUPPORT ALL THE GUN REFORM HERE. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA OUR KIDS HAVE. TRAUMA BASED SKILLS IN EVERY SCHOOL. SOCIAL BASED LEARNING IN EVERY SCHOOL. 90% OF THE THE SHOOTERS COMING FROM THE SCHOOLS THEY ARE IN AND 70% FEEL SHAMED TRAUMATICIZED OR BULLIED. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THESE KIDS FEEL CONNECTED TO THE SCHOOL, THAT MEANS A MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR IN EVERY SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED TO PLAY OFFENSE. OUR KIDS ARE SO TRAUMATICIZED THEY'RE GETTING A GUN AND GOING TO SCHOOL WE ARE DID DOING SOMETHING WRONG TOO AND WE NEED REFORM. &gt;&gt; CAMPAIGNED ALL OVER THE STATE IN 2018 IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PARTS THERE. WHAT DO YOU TELL A GUN OWNER WHO MAY AGREE WITH YOU ON EVERYTHING ELSE BE, OKAY BUT SAYS YOU KNOW THE THE DEMOCRATS IF I VOTE FOR THEM THEY'RE TAKING MY GUN AWAY. AND EVEN THOUGH I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE OTHER ISSUES HOW DO YOU HAVE THAT CONVERSATION? &gt;&gt; HERE IS HOW WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION IN TEXAS, I SHARED WITH THEM WHAT I LEARNED FROM THOSE STUDENTS WHO SURVIVED THE SANTA FE HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING OF A YOUNG STUDENT NAMED BREE. HER FRIEND MARCEL SURVIVED ANOTHER SHOOTING, THE MOTHER OF A VICTIM WHO LOST HER LIFE TALKING ABOUT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WHERE YOU CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES. WE KNOW THEY SAVE LIVES. ENDING THE SALES OF ASSAULT WEAPONS IN THE KMUPTS, THE WEAPONS OF WAR DESIGNED TO KILL PEOPLE AS EFFECTIVELY AND FURTHER EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. THEY BELONG ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND NOT IN THE COMMUNITY. RED FLAG LAWS SO IF SOMEONE POSES A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS TO STOP BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. WHAT I FOUND IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES IS THAT DEMOCRATS AND INFENCE AND REPUBLICANS, GUN OWNERS AND NON-GUN OWNERS ALIKE AGREE THAT THIS EFFORT MUST BE LED WHICH THE YOUNG PEOPLE YOU RERNSED EARLIER. THE STUDENTS LED THE CHARGE HERE IN FLORIDA AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE LAWS. THEY ARE MAKING OUR DEMOCRACY WORK. ENSURING VALUES AND INTERESTS AND PRIORITIES ARE REFLECTED IN THE LAWS THAT WE PASS. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU CONGRESSWOMAN O'ROURKE. HANG ON. LET ME GIVE 30 SECONDS TO SENATOR KLOBUCHAR. IRON RANGE. GUN CONPHYSICAL ACCUSATION IF THE GOVERNMENT IS BUYING BACK HOW DO YOU NOT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT CONPHYSICALIZATION INDICATION YOU GIVE THEM THE OFFER TO BUY IT BACK. I LOOK AT THE PROPOSALS AND I SAY DOES THIS HURT MY UNCLE DICK AND HER DEER STAND COMING FROM A PROUD HUNTING STATE. THESE PROPOSAL DON'T. WHEN I I WAS A PROSECUTOR I SUPPORTED THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN. I SAW THE MOMS FROM SANDY HOOK ADD SFROEKT FOR CHANGE AND WE FAILED AND NOW THE PARKLAND KIDS FROM FLORIDA, THEY STARTED A NATIONAL IT'S LIKE WHEN GAY MARRIAGE WHEN KIDS TALK TO GRANDPARENTS AND PARENTS ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND THIS IS THE BEST THING SFL SENATOR BOOKER LET ME GO TO YOU ON ANOTHER MATTER. &gt;&gt; SENATOR McCONNELL SAYS HIS MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ACHIEVEMENT WAS PREVENTING PRESIDENT OBAMA FROM FILLING THE SUPREME COURT SEAT. HAVING SERVED WITH REPUBLICANS ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DO YOU BELIEVE THEY WOULD CONFIRM YOUR COURT NOMINEES? &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO USE 20 OF MY SECONDS. THERE IS ONE THING WE DON'T AGREE WITH GUNS IT'S COMMON SENSE AND THINGS AMERICANS AGREE WITH IF YOU NEED A LICENSE TO DRIVE A CAR. YOU SHOULD NEED A LICENSE TO BUY AND OWN A FIREARM. AND NOT EVERYBODY IN IN FIELD AGREE WAS THAT. BUT IN STATES LIKE CONNECTICUT THAT DID THAT THEY SAW 40% DROP IN GUN VIOLENCE AND 15% TROP IN SUICIDE. WE NEED BOLD AGENDAS ON GUNS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUPREME COURT VERY CLEARLY WE -- I GROW WITH MY FRIENDS SECRETARY CASTRO, WE ARE GOING TO GET TO 50 VOTES IN THE SENATE. THIS IS 18 WHOEVER NOMINEE NEEDS TO CAMPAIGN IN PLACES LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA BECAUSE WE CAN ELECT JAMIE HARRISON. THEY NEED TO CAMPAIGN IN PLACES LIKE IOWA WE CAN WIN A SENATE SEAT THERE. THIS IS ABOUT GETTING US BACK TO HAVING 50 VOTES IN THE SENATE AND MORE SO WE CAN NOT ONLY BALANCE THE SUPREME COURT BUT START TO PASS AN AGGRESSIVE AGENDA THAT FRANKLY ISN'T SO AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE MOST OF AMERICA AGREES WITH THE POLICY OBJECT HE WAS OF OUR PARTY. &gt;&gt; MAYOR DE BLASIO, ON A FOLLOW UP, MAYOR DE BLASIO. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN DELAINE YOU'LL HAVE TIME IN A MOMENT. I'LL GIVE YOU TIME IN A MOMENT MAYOR DE BLASIO AS EXECUTIVE IN THE LARGEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY YOU ARE USED TO SAYING WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN AND HAVING IT HAPPEN. IF YOU NOMINATE A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND MITCH KPAUNL IS STILL SENATE MAJORITY LEADER WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW YOU TO MAKE A NOMINEE. &gt;&gt; RACHEL, I AM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST CITY I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING QUICK ON THE GUN ISSUE AND COME TO YOUR QUESTION. I RUN THE LARGEST POLICE FORCE IN AMERICA TOO AND IF WE STOP THE SHOOTINGS AND GET THE GUNS OFF THE STREET WE HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE AND COMMUNITY. I WANT TO SAY THAT SOMETHING THAT SETS ME APART FROM MY COLLEAGUES RUNNING IN THIS RACE AND THAT IS FOR THE LAST 21 YEARS I'VE BEEN RAISING THE A BLACK SON IN AMERICA. AND I HAVE HAD TO HAVE VERY, VERY SERIOUS TALKS WITH MY SON ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT HIMSELF ON THE STREETS OF OUR CITY AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING HOW TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE SPECIAL CAUTIONS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY TRAGEDIES BETWEEN YOUNG MEN AND POLICE TOO AS WE SAW RECENTLY IN INDIANA. WE NEED TO TO HAVE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION IN THE COUNTRY ABOUT GUNS BUT ALSO DIFFERENT CONVERSATION ABOUT POLICING THAT BRINGS POLICING AND COMMUNITY TOGETHER WE HAVE DONE THAT IN NEW YORK CITY AND DRIVEN DOWN CRIME WHILE DOING IT. BUT THE QUESTION ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL THERE IS A POLITICAL SOLUTION WE HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS. IF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY WOULD STOP ACTING LIKE THE PARTY OF THE ELITE AND BE THE PARTY OF THE WORKING PEOPLE AND GO INTO RED STATES TO CONVINCE PEOPLE WE ARE ON THEIR SIDE WE CAN PUT PRESSURE ON THEIR SENATORS TO ASK THEM TO VOTE FOR THE NOMINEES THAT ARE PUT FORWARD TO PRESERVE. &gt;&gt; SENATOR WARREN. &gt;&gt; -- I WANT TO GET -- I WILL GET YOU 30 SECONDS. I PROMISE LECHLT GET THIS QUESTION. WE'RE TRYING WE GOT OTHER ISSUES WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO INCLUDING A BIG ONE IN A MINNESOTA. SENATOR WARREN I WANT TO CONTINUE ON THE MITCH McCONNELL THING. BECAUSE YOU HAVE AMBITIOUS PLANS YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT, OKAY. WE TALKED ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT. DO YOU HAVE A PLAN TO DEAL WITH MITCH McCONNELL IF YOU DON'T BEAT HIM IN THE SENATE, IF HE STILL SITTING THERE AS THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, IT'S VERY PLAUSIBLE YOU'D BE ELECTED PRESIDENT WITH A REPUBLICAN SENATE DO YOU HAVE A PLAN TO DEAL WITH MITCH McCONNELL. &gt;&gt; I DO. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; WE ARE A DEMOCRACY. AND THE WAY A DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO WORK IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE MATTERS. NOW, WE FOR FAR TOO LONG HAVE HAD A CONGRESS IN WASHINGTON THAT IS JUST COMPLETELY DISMISSED WHAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THEY HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY WORK MUCH BETTER FOR THOSE WHO CAN MAKE GIANT CONTRIBUTIONS, MADE IT BETTER FOR THOSE WHO HIRE ARMIES OF LOBBYISTS AEN LAWYERS AND NOT FOR THE PEOPLE HOOP. HERE IS HOW I SEE THIS HAPPENING. NUMBER ONE SURE I WANT TO SEE A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. BUT SHORT OF A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN THE SENATE YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FIGHT STILL GOES ON. IT STARTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND IT MEANS THAT EVERYBODY WE ENERGIZE IN 2020 STAYS ON THE FRONT LINES COME JANUARY 2021. WE HAVE TO PUSH FUNDING, OUTSIDE, HAVE LETTEREDSHIP FROM THE INSIDE AND MAKE THIS CONGRESS REFLECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GET A COUPLE OF YOU IN HERE. I'M GETTING A COUPLE IN HERE. 30 SECONDS. CONGRESSMAN DELANEY. YOU SEEM TO BELIEVE YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER. MITCH McCONNELL DOESN'T OPERATE THAT WAY. HE OPERATES DIFFERENTLY. WHY DO YOU THINK HE IS GOING TO CONFORM TO YOUR STYLE. &gt;&gt; I THINK WE NEED TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE WE NEED TO OPERATE IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER. I'LL SIGN INTO LAW BILLS THAT COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE THAT ARE PASSED ON A PARTY LINE BASIS ABSOLUTELY. BUT ALL THE BIG TRANSFORMATIVE THINGS WE HAVE DONE IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY HAVE HAPPENED WHEN HUGE MAJORITIES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET BEHIND THEM. WHICH IS WHY WE NEED REAL SOLUTIONS, NOT IMPOSSIBLE PROMISEDS. WE NEED TO PUT FORTH IDEAS WHETHER IT'S ON HEALTHCARE CREATING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SO EVERY AMERICAN GETS HEALTH CARE BUT NOT RUNNING ON MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE ILLEGAL. THE GUN ISSUE IS RELATED. THE GUN SAFETY ISSUE IS RELATED. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN WITH FOLKS IN WESTERN MARYLAND AND THEY'VE SAID TO ME, YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS DON'T DO ANYTHING FOR US. REPUBLICANS DON'T DO ANYTHING FOR US. YOU FIGHT ALL THE TIME. SO THEY VOTE ON THAT SINGLE ISSUE. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; IF WE BECOME THE PARTY OF GETTING THINGS DONE. &gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND. &gt;&gt; FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH THE REAL LUGS NOM IMPOSSIBLE PROMISING. &gt;&gt; SENATOR BOOKER, 30 SECONDS, HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH MITCH -- YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE. YOU CAN'T GET BILTS ON THE FLOOR RIGHT NOW WITH MITCH McCONNELL. PRESIDENTS CAN'T DO IT. IS PRESIDENT BOOKER GETTING HIS BILLS ON THE FLOOR WITH SENATOR McCONNELL &gt;&gt; WHEN I GOT TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN IN A OF COURSEN AMERICAN DOMINATED COMMUNITY I KNEW ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM FROM POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY TO DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A NATION WITH MORE AFRICAN-AMERICANS UNDER CRIMINAL SUPERVISION THAN ALL THE SLAVES IN 1850 A WHEN I GOT TO THE SENATE PEOPLE TOLD ME WE COULDN'T GET COMPREHENSIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DONE. I BOUGHT ON THAT BILL. BUILT COAL I GUESSES TODAY WE PASSED THE FIRST STEP ACT NOT AS FAR AS I WANT TO GO BUT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILL BE LISH LIBER EIGHTED I'VE TAKEN ON TOUGH PROBLEMS PEOPLED WHO PEOPLE SAID WE CAN'T ACHIEVE AND GOT THINGS ACCOMPLISHED. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU SENATOR BOOKER NEXT QUESTION. &gt;&gt; HOLD ON, GOVERNOR YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY WITH WHERE GOVERNOR INK INSLEE THIS NEXT ISSUE IS TO YOU. YOU GOT ME? &gt;&gt; GOT ME. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE STAKED YOUR CANDIDACY ON THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S FIRST SECOND AND THIRD PRIORITY FOR YOU. YOU SAID IT'S ALL THE ISSUES. LET'S GET SPECIFIC. WE'RE HERE IN MIAMI ALREADY EXPERIENCING SERIOUS FLOODING ON SUNNY KEAYS AS A RESULT OF SEA LEVEL RISE. PARTS OF MIAMI BEACH AND THE KEYS COULD BE UNDER WATER IN OUR LIFETIME. DOES YOUR PLAN SAVE MIAMI. &gt;&gt; YES FIRST BY TAKING AWAY THE PILL BUSTER FROM MITCH McCONNELL TO START WITH. WE HAVE TO DO THAT. LOOK, WE ARE THE FIRST GENERATION TO FEEL THE STING OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND WE ARE THE LAST THAT CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. OUR TOWNS ARE BURNING. THE FIELDS ARE FLODING. MIAMI IS INUNDATED. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A CLIMATE CRISIS. AN EMERGENCY. AND IT IS A OUR LAST CHANCE IN THE ADMINISTRATION NEXT ONE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND WE NEED TO DO WHAT I'VE DONE IN MY STATE. WE PASSED A 10 OH% CLEAN ELECTRICAL GRID BILL. WE NOW HAVE A VISION STATEMENT AND MY PLAN PLAN HAS BEEN CALLED THE GOLD STANDARD OF PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON THIS AND THE BIGGEST DECISION FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS, WHO IS GOING TO MAKE THIS THE FIRST PRIORITY? AND I AM THE CANDIDATE AND THE ONLY ONE WHO SAYS THIS HAS TO BE THE TOP PRIORITY OF THE UNITED STATES. THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE TO MOBILIZE THE UNITED STATES SO THAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE, LEAD THE WORLD AND INVENT THE FUTURE AND PUT 8 MILLION PEOPLE TO WORK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. &gt;&gt; GOVERNOR. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE YOU ALSO PUT OUT A BIG CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN FROM YOUR CAMPAIGN. YOU WANT BIG CHANGES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. INCLUDING SWITCHING TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. SWITCHING FROM GAS POWERED CARS TO ELECTRIC ONES WHAT'S THE ABOUT A VOTE WHO WANTS TO DO THAT BUT WHAT ABOUT A GOVERNMENT BEING ORDER ORDERING PEOPLE HOW TO LIVE. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY IN THE SLAUGSS AND CHALLENGES AND WE FACE. THAT'S WHY WE TRAVEL EVERYWHERE LISTENING TO EVERYONE. WE WERE IN PACIFIC JUNCTION, A TOWN THAT HAD NEVER MEANINGFULLY FLOODED BEFORE UP AGAINST THE MISSOURI RIVER IN IOWA. AND EVERY HOME IN THE COMMUNITY HAD FLOODED. THERE WERE FARMS JUST OUTSIDE OF THE PACIFIC JUNCTION THAT WERE EFFECTIVELY LAKES. THOSE FARMERS ALREADY UNDER WATER IN DEBT, THEIR MARKETS CLOSED TO THEM BY A TRADE WAR UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION. AND NOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE IN OUR ADMINISTRATION ARE GOING TO FUND RESILIENCY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES IN MIAMI, IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. THOSE PLACES THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF CLIMATE CHANGE TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO MOBILIZE $5 TRILLION IN THE ECONOMY IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. FREE OURSELVES FROM DEPENDENS ON FOSSIL FUEL AND PUT FARMERS AND RANCHERS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE TO MAKE SURE WE CAPTURE MORE CARBON FROM THE AIR AND KEEP IT IN THE SOIL. PAYING FARMERS IF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES THEPTS TO PROVIDE. IF ALL OF US DO ALL WE CAN THEN WE CAN KEEP THIS PLANET FROM WARMING ANOTHER TWO DEGREES CELSIUS AND ENSURE WE MATCH WHAT THIS COUNTRY CAN DO AND LIVE UP TO THE PROMISED AND PENSION. &gt;&gt; 30 SECONDS, SECRETARY CASTRO, DOES -- WHO PAYS FOR THE MITIGATION TO CHIEMT, WHETHER BUILDING SEA WALL, FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE PERHAPS LIVING IN PLACES THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE LIVING? IS THIS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUE THAT NEED TO DO THAT? DO THEY HAVE TO MOVE THESE PEOPLE? WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THAT WHERE MAYBE THEY'RE -- THEY'RE BUILDING A HOUSE SOMEPLACE THAT ISN'T SAFE? WHO PAYS TO BUILD THAT HOUSE? HOW MUCH SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT BE BAILING THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THAT REPRESENTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF ISSUE. MY FIRST VISIT AFTER I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY WASN'T TO IOWA OR NEW HAMPSHIRE IT WAS TO SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO. BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, EVERYBODY WILL COUNT. AND YOU KNOW, I'M ONE OF THE FEW CANDIDATES IN THE RACE WITH EXECUTIVE EXPERIENCE. WITH A TRACK RECORD OF GETTING THINGS DONE. WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF SAN ANTONIO WE MOVED THE LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITY. WE BEGAN TO SHIFT FROM COAL FIRED PLANT TO SOLAR AND OTHER RENEWABLE AND ALSO CREATED MORE THAN 800 JOBS DOING THAT. WHEN I WAS HUD SECRETARY WE WORKED ON THE NATIONAL DISASTER RESILIENCE COMPETITION TO INVEST IN COMMUNITIES TRYING TO REBUILD FROM NATURAL DISASTERS IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL SAFER IN THE YEARS TO COME AND THAT WE COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE IF I'M EKT EYED PRESIDENT THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO LIKE SENATOR KLOBUCHAR ALSO SAID IS SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDER RECOMMITTING US TO THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. CONGRESSMAN RYAN I HAVE A FULL QUESTION FOR YOU HERE WHICH IS SIMPLY THAT YOU'RE -- THERE ARE A LOT OF CLIMATE PLANS INCLUDE PRICING CASH BE TAXING CARBON THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN TRIED IN A FEW PLACES WHETHER WEATHER STATE WHERE VOTERS VOTE TO DO DOWN. YOU HAVE THE YELLOW VEST MOVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA. ONE PARTY REJECTED OUT OF FEAR OF THE COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE SORT OF BEING PUT ON THE BACKS OF THE CONSUMER. IF PRICING CARBON IS JUST POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE HOW DO WE PAY FOR CLIMATE MITIGATION? &gt;&gt; WELL, THERE IS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO PAY. WE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS OF RAISING REVENUE. I THINK WE HAVE TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS AND GROW OUR WAY OUT. LET ME TALK RELEVANT REAL QUICK TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION ABOUT REAL POLITICS WE COULD TALK ABOUT CLIMATE, GUNS, TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE ALL CARE ABOUT. WE HAVE A PERCEPTION PROBLEM WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE ARE NOT CONNECTING TO THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE IN THE VERY STATES THAT I REPRESENT IN OHIO, IN THE INDUSTRIAL MIDWEST. WE HAVE LOST ALL CONNECTION. WE HAVE GOT TO CHANGE THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FROM BEING COASTAL AND ELITELE -- ELITIST AND IVY LEAGUE, WHICH IS THE PERCEPTION TO SOMEBODY FROM THE FORGOTTEN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND THE LAST 30 YEARS. TOGETHER THE WORKERS BACK ON OUR SIDE. SO WE CAN SAY WE'RE GOING TO BUILD ELECTRIC VEHICLES, BUILD SOLAR PANELS. IF YOU WANT TO BEAT MITCH McCONNELL THIS BETTER BE A WORKING CLASS PARTY IF YOU WANT TO GO TO KENTUCKY AND TAKE HIS REAR END OUT AND TAKE LINDSEY YAUM OUT YOU GOT TO HAVE THE BLUE COLLAR PARTY THAT GOES IN THE TEXTILE FACTORIES IN NORTH CAROLINA. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU CONGRESSMAN RYAN. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU CONGRESSMAN RYAN. &gt;&gt; ALL I'M SAYING IF WE DON'T DRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH OUR CONNECTION TO WORKERS WHITE BLACK BROWN, GAY STRAIT, WORKING CLASS PEOPLE NONE GETS DONE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE -- CONGRESSMAN DELANEY I'M GOING TO GET TO YOU. &gt;&gt; I INTRODUCED THE ONLY BIPARTISAN CARBON TAX BILL. &gt;&gt; 30 SECONDS, GOV. &gt;&gt; ALL THE ECONOMISTS AGREE THAT A CARBON PRICING MECHANISM WORKS. YOU JUST HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT. YOU CAN'T PUT A PROVIDES ON CARBON, RAISE ENERGY PRICES AND NOT GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. MY PROPOSAL WHICH IS PUT A PRICE ON CARBON GIVE A DIVIDEND BACK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IT GOES OUT ONE POCKET, BACK IN THE OTHER. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU CONGRESSMAN. &gt;&gt; I CAN GET THAT PASSED MY FIRTS YEAR OF PRESIDENT WITH A COALITION OF EVERY EXACT IN THE CONGRESS AND THE REPUBLICANS LIVING IN COASTAL STATES. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU GOVERNOR. &gt;&gt; FLORIDA, THEY ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THIS. &gt;&gt; THEY DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. &gt;&gt; THIS HAS TO BE OUR WAY FORWARD IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THE ISSUE. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSWOMAN GABBARD, WE'RE MOVING HERE. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU DID AFTER LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN WAS TO ISSUE AN APOLOGY TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY ABOUT YOUR PAST ANSWERS AND STANCES AND STATEMENTS ON GAY RIGHTS. AFTER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ROLLBACK OF CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTION FOR MANY IN THAT COMMUNITY, WHY SHOULD VOTERS IN THAT COMMUNITY OR VOTERS THAT CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN GENERAL TRUST YOU NOW? &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THAT THERE IS NO ONE IN OUR GOVERNMENT AT ANY LEVEL WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL ANY AMERICAN WHO THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO LOVE OR WHO SHE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO MARRY. MY RECORD IN CONGRESS OVER SIX YEARS SHOWS MY COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING FOR LGBTQ EQUALITY. I SERVE ON THE EQUALITY CAUCUS AND RECENT VOTED FOR PASSAGE OF THE EQUALITY ACT. [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; MAYBE MANY IN THE COUNTRY CAN RELATE TO THE FACT I GREW UP IN A SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE HOME HELD VIEWS WHEN I WAS YOUNG I NO LONGER SERVE TODAY. I SERVED WITH LGBTQ SERVICE MEMBERS IN TRAINING AND DOWN RANGE. THEY WOULD GIVE THEIR LIFE FOR ME AND I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE FOR THEM. IT'S THIS COMMITMENT I CARRY THROUGH ASP OF THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZING THERE ARE TILL PEOPLE FACING SKRIMS IN THE WORKPLACE. STILL PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO FIND A HOME FOR FAMILIES. AND IT'S THIS KIND OF DISCRIMINATION THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU CONGRESSWOMAN. &gt;&gt; IF I CAN ADD TO THAT. &gt;&gt; 30 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. CIVIL RIGHTS IS THE PLACE TO BEGIN. BUT IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS COMMUNITY ANOTHER PLACE TO FOCUS ON IS STOP OF LYNCHING OF AFRICAAMERICANS. WE DO NOT TALK ABOUT TRANSAMERICANS, ESPECIALLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS TRANSAMERICAN AND THE INCREDIBLY HIGH RATE OF MURDER RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT HOW MANY CHILDREN 30% OF LGBTQ KIDS WHO DON'T GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE OF FEAR. IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO BE ON THE EQUALITY ACT. I'M AN ORIGINAL CORESPONSE ARE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT WILL FIGHT TO PROTECT LGBTQ AMERICANS EVERY SINGLE DAY. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU SENATOR BOOKER. &gt;&gt; SENATOR KLOBUCHAR ON THE ISSUE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, FOR DECADES IT -- CIVIL RIGHTS AND DEMOGRAPHICS HONESTLY AND POLITICS. FOR DECADES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS COUNTED ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTER TURNOUT TO STEP BUN AS WINNING ON NATIONAL LEVEL. DEMOCRATS ARE COUNTING ON THE LATINO COMMUNITY NOW AND IN THE FUTURE IN THE SAME WAY. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR BLACK AND LATINO VOTERS THAT SHOULD INCLUDE THEM ABOUT GOING TO THE POLLS FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; MY LIFE AND CAREER AND WORK IN THE SENATE HAS BEEN ABOUT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. AND TO ME IN MEANS BETTER CHILD CARE FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS YOU NEED TO TO HAVE RETIREMENT THAT WORKS. YOU NEED TO HAVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT WORK. AND YOU ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE ABLE TO GET KNOWS JOBS OF THE FUTURE, THE S.T.E.M. JOBS. DONALD TRUMP ONE OF THE FIRST BILLS THAT HE SIGNED OF THE 34 HE SIGNED WHERE I WAS THE LEAD DEMOCRAT, OKAY THAT'S A FIRST UP HERE, WAS ONE THAT THAT WAS ABOUT THAT. MAKING SURE MINORITIES COMMUNITY MEMBERS COULD SHARE IN THOSE JOBS. SO TO ME, THIS IS ABOUT A FEW THINGS. IT'S ABOUT AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN GOING TO A HOSPITAL IN NEW ORLEANS SAYS HER HANDS ARE SWOLLEN AND THEN DOCTOR IGNORES HER BABY DIES. IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN MAKE 61 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR A WHITE MAN MAKES. IN SHORT WE NEED TO ONE -- I WILL DO IN IN THE IRIS FIRST 100 DAYS AS PRESIDENT MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE CAN VOTE AT THIS TABLE. EVERYONE CAN VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY AND ALSO GO TO THE NEXT STEP OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. SENATOR BOOKER AND I WORKED ON THAT FIRST STEP ACT. BUT WE SHOULD GO TO THE SECOND STEP ACT. WHICH IS TO HELP ALL OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE. &gt;&gt; SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 30 SECOND FOLLOW UP TO YOU SECRETARY CASTRO THIS IS A 70% LATINO CITY IN MIAMI. YOU ARE THE ONLY LATINO EXACT RUNNING THIS YEAR IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. &gt;&gt; [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; IS THAT ENOUGH AS AN ANSWER WHAT SENATOR CHOEB CHAR ECONOMIC JUSTICE AGENDA IS THAT ENOUGH TO MOBILIZE LATINO VOTE TORS STAND WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN A BIG WAY. &gt;&gt; I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE RACIAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. I WAS IN CHARLESTON NOT LONG AGO. AND I REMEMBERED I REMEMBERED THAT DYLAN ROOF WENT THE MOTHER EMMANUEL AME CHURCH AND MURDERED NINE PEOPLE WORSHIPPING AND THEN APPREHENDED BY POLICE WITHOUT INCIDENT. WHAT ABOUT ERIC GARDENER AND TAMIR RICE AND LA QUAN McDONALD AND SANDRA BLAND ANTONIO. I'M PROUD I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE SO FAR THAT PROCESS UT FORWARD LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REFORM THE POLICING SYSTEM IN AMERICA AND MAKE SURE NO MATTER THE COLOR OF THE SKIN THAT YOU ARE TREATED THE SAME, INCLUDING LATINOS. WHO ARE MISS TREATED TOO OFTEN BY POLICE. &gt;&gt; SECRETARY CASTRO THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; LET ME GO TO LESTER HOLT WHO HAS A QUESTION A VIEWER QUESTION. &gt;&gt; I'M OVER HERE CHUCK, THANKS. WE ASKED VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO SNIT QUESTIONS TO THE CANDIDATES. LET ME READ ONE FROM JEAN IN NEW YORK WHO SUBMITTED THIS. HE ASKED DOES THE UNITED STATES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT IN THE CASE OF GENOCIDE OR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY DO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO INTERVENE TO PROTECT PEOPLE THREATENED BY THEIR GOVERNMENTS EVEN WHEN ATROCITIES DO NOT AFFECT AMERICAN CORE INTERESTS? I'D LIKE TO DIRECT THAT QUESTION TO CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE. &gt;&gt; JOHN, I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. THE ANSWER IS YES. BUT THAT ACTION SHOULD ALWAYS BE UNDERTAKEN WITH ALLIES AND PARTNERS AND FRIENDS. WHEN THE UNITED STATES PRESENTS A UNITED FRONT WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF ACHIEVING OUR FOREIGN POLICY AIMS. AND PREVENTING THE KIND OF GENOCIDE TO WHICH YOU REFER, THE KIND OF GENOCIDE WE SAW IN RWANDA, THE COINED OF GENOCIDE WE WANT TO STOP GOING FORWARD. BUT UNFORTUNATELY UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALIENATED OUR ALLIES AND OUR FRIENDS. AND OUR ALLIANCES. HE HAS DIMINISHED OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD. AND MADE US WEAKER AS A COUNTRY. LESS ABLE TO CONFRONT CHALLENGES WHETHER IT'S IRAN OR NORTH KOREA OR VLADIMIR PUTIN IN REFRESH WHO ATTACKED AND INVADED OUR DEMOCRACY IN SOUF AND WHO PRESIDENT TRUMP OFFERED ANOTHER INVITATION TO DO THE SAME. HE HAS EMBRACED STRONGMEN AND DICTATORS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE GREAT DEMOCRACIES. AS PRESIDENT I WILL MAKE SURE WE LIVE OUR VALUES IN OUR FOREIGN POLICY. I WILL ENSURE THAT WE STRENGTHEN THE ALIGNS AND PARTNERSHIPS AND FRIENDSHIPS AND MEET ANY CHALLENGE WE FACE TOGETHER. THAT MAKES AMERICA STRONGER. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE WAR -- &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE WAR POWERS ACT BE PART OF THE EE KWIGS WITH DEEP RESPECT TO THE CONGRESSMAN. WE LEARNED PAINFUL LESSONS AS AMERICANS WE WENT TO WAR WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION. MY DAD SERVED IN THE PACIFIC IN THE WORLD WAR II IN THE U.S. ARMY. BAMGTS OF OKINAWA, HAD HALF HIS LEG BLOWN OFF CAME HOME WITH SCARS PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HE SPIRLED DOWNWARD AND ULTIMATELY TOOK HIS LIFE. AND THAT BATTLE DIDN'T KILL HIM BUT THAT WAR DID. AND LOOK, EVEN IN THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS -- I THINK WE SHOULD BE READY, CONGRESSMAN TO INTERVENE, GOD FORBID A GENOCIDE. BUT NOT WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE CONGRESS HAVE NOT CHALLENGED PRESIDENTS AND LET THEM GET AWAY WITH RUNNING THE MILITARY WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL PRUCHL. WE LEARNED A LESSON IN VIETNAM WE SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO PICK UP THIS POINT AND PUT THIS CONGRESSMAN RYAN. TODAY THE TALIBAN CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR KILLING TWO AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS IN AFGHANISTAN. LEADERS ARE ZPRAT AS PONN ABPRESIDENT TRUMP BOTH SAID THEY WANT TO END U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN WITH YOU IT ISN'T OVER FOR AMERICA. WHICH ISN'T IT OVER? WHY CAN'T PRESIDENTS OF DIFFERENT PARTIES AND TEMPER MTS GET US OUT OF THERE? AND HOW COULD YOU. &gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION. BUT I'VE BEEN IN CONGRESS 17 YEARS. AND 12 OF THE YEARS I'VE SAT ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, THE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE OR THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. AND THE LESSON I LEARNED OVER THE YEARS TESLA YOU HAVE TO STAY ENGAGED IN THE SITUATIONS. NOBODY LIKES IT. IT'S LONG. IT'S TEDIOUS. BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE -- I WOULD SAY WE MUST BE IN ENGAGED IN THIS. WE MUST HAVE OUR STATE DEPARTMENT ENGAGED. MUST HAVE OUR MILITARY ENGAGED TO THE EXTENT THEY NEED TO BE. BUT THE REALITY OF IT IS THIS PRESIDENT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE PEOPLE APPOINTED IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS. WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTRAL AMERICA, WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IRAN, WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AFGHANISTAN. WE HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY ENGAGED. AND HERE IS WHY, BECAUSE THESE FLARE-UPS DISTRACT US FROM THE REAL PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTRY. IF GETTING A DRONE SHOT DOWN FOR $130 MILLION BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS DISTRACTED, THAT'S $130 MILLION THAT WE COULD BE SPENDING IN PLACES LIKE YUNGSTOWN OHIO OB FLINT, HAWAII OR REBUILDING. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN RYAN I GIVE YOU 30 SECONDS TO JUMP OFF WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; TELL THE PARENTS OF THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE JUST KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN WELL WE JUST HAVE TO BE ENGAGED. AS A SOLDIER I WILL TELL THAT YOU ANSWER IS UNACCEPTABLE. WE HAVE TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME FROM AFGHANISTAN. WE ARE IN A PLACE IN AFGHANISTAN WHERE WE HAVE LOST SO MANY LIVES. WE HAVE SPENT SO MUCH MONEY. MONEY THAT'S COMING OUT OF EVERY ONE OF OUR POCKETS. MONEY THAT SHOULD BE GOING INTO COMMUNITIES HERE AT HOME MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE HERE AT HOME. WE ARE NO BETTER OFF IN AFGHANISTAN TODAY THAN WE WERE WHEN THIS WAR BEGAN. THIS IS WAY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PRESIDENT COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO KNOWS THE COST OF WAR AND READY TO DO THE JOB ONDY ONE. I AM READY TO DO THAT JOB WHEN I WALK INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO GO DONE THE LINE. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THE LINE HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU FELT LIKE SHE WAS RESPONDING TO YOU YOU GET 30 SECONDS FAIR ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE THAT. &gt;&gt; I HEAR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE ENGAGED. I WISH WE WERE SPENDING ALL THE MONEY IN PLACES THAT I REPRESENTED THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN. AND WE WERE REBUILDING. BUT THE REALITY OF IT IS THAT THE UNITED STATES ISN'T ENGAGED. THE TALIBAN WILL GROW. AND THEY WILL HAVE BIGGER, BOLDER TERRORIST ACCURACY A. WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME PRESENCE THERE. &gt;&gt; THE TALIBAN WAS THERE LONG BEFORE WE CAME IN. THEY WILL BE THERE LONG AFTER WE LEAVE. &gt;&gt;' THEN. &gt;&gt; THINKING WE ARE GOING TO SOMEHOW SQUASH THIS TALIBAN THAT'S BEEN THERE IN EVERY OTHER COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; WE WEREN'T IN THERE THEY STARTED FLYING PLANES INTO OUR BUILDINGS. I'M JUST SAYING RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE. &gt;&gt;ABLE AT AEN DIDN'T ATTACK US ON 9/11. I'LL TELL YOU THIS. &gt;&gt; WELL I HAVE. &gt;&gt; AL QAEDA ATTACKED ON 9/11 THAT'S WHICH WE JOINED THE MILITARY TO GO AFTER AL QAEDA NOT THE TALIBAN. &gt;&gt; THE TALIBAN. &gt;&gt; THE TALIBAN WAS PROTECTING THE PEOPLE PLOTTING AGAINST US. ALL I'M SAYING IS IF WE WANT TO GO IN TO ELECTIONS AND WE WANT TO SAY THAT WE GOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE WORLD, THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SAYING. WE CAN'T -- I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO DOWN THE LINE FINISH UP FOREIGN POLICY. SIMPLE QUESTION. WHAT'S THE BIGGEST -- WHO IS THE GEOPOLITICAL THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES GIVE ME A ONE WORD ANSWER, CONGRESSMAN DELANEY. &gt;&gt; COULD YOU REPEAT THE. &gt;&gt; GREATEST GEOPOLITICAL THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW CONGRESSMAN DELANEY. &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST POLITICAL CHALLENGE IS CHINA BUT THE BIGGEST GEOPOLITICAL THREAT REMAINS NUCLEAR WEAPON ZBLOOPS GOVERNOR INSLEE. &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES OF THE UNITED STATES IS DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN GABBARD. &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST GEOPOLITICAL THREAT. &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST THREAT WE FACE IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE AT GREATEST GREATER RISK OF NUCLEAR WAR THAN EVER BEFORE IN HISTORY TWO THREATS, ECONOMIC THREATS, CHF BUT OUR MAJOR THREAT RIGHT NOW IS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MIDWEST WITH IRAN IF WE DOT DON'T GET IT TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; ONE OR TWO WORDS. &gt;&gt; OUR EXISTENTIAL THREAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE TO CONFRONT IT BEFORE IT'S TOO RATE. &gt;&gt; SENATOR WARREN. &gt;&gt; CLIMATE CHANGE. &gt;&gt; NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION AND CLAIM CHANGES. &gt;&gt; SECRETARY CASTRO. &gt;&gt; CHINA AND CLIMATE CHANGE. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN RYAN. &gt;&gt; CHINA WITHOUT A QUESTION. THEY'RE WIPING US OUT AROUND THE WORLD CHECKICALLY. &gt;&gt; AND MR. MAYOR. &gt;&gt; RUSSIA BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY AND DOING PRETTY DAMN GOOD JOB AND WE NEED TO STOP THEM. &gt;&gt; WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT WIDE VARIETY OF ANSWERS. AND I MEAN THAT. I MEAN THAT -- THAT'S WHAT THIS DEBATE IS ABOUT. THIS IS THE BEST PART OF A DEBATE LIKE THIS. CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE PB SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER'S REPORT OUTLINES MULTIPLE INSS OF POTENTIAL CRIMINAL BEHAVIORALLY PRESIDENT TRUMP. HOUSE SPEAKER SPEAKER PELOSI HAS RESISTED ANY MOVE TOWARD IMPEACHMENT IN THE HOUSE. IF THE HOUSE CHOOSES NOT TO IMPEACH, AS PRESIDENT WOULD YOU DO ANYTHING TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL CRIMES OUTLINED IN MR. MUELLER'S REPORT? &gt;&gt; YES. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. &gt;&gt; HOW BY THE WAY IF THE ANSWER IS YES. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PIECES OF ART IN THE UNITED STATES CAPITAL IS THE PAINTING OF JORNL GEORGE WASHINGTON RESIGNING HIS COMMISSION TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS AT THE HEIGHT OF POWER SUBMITTING TO THE RULE OF THE LAW AND WILL OF THE PEOPLE. THAT HAS WITH STOOD THE TEST OF TIME FOR THE LAST 243 YEARS. IF WE SET ANOTHER PRECEDENT NOW THAT A CANDIDATE WHO INVITED THE PARTICIPATION OF A FOREIGN POWER, A PRESIDENT WHO SOUGHT TO OBSTRUCT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE INVASION OF OUR DEMOCRACY, IF WE ALLOW HIM TO GET AWAY WITH THIS WITH COMPLETE IMPUNITY THEN WE WILL SET A NEW STANDARD THAT IS SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE POSITION OF POWER AND PUBLIC TRUST THEY HOLD ARE ABOVE THE LAW. AND WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO STAND. WE MUST BEGIN IMPEACHMENT NOW SO THAT WE HAVE THE FACTS AND TRUTH AND WE FOLLOW THEM AS FAR AS THEY GO AND AS HIGH AS THEY REACH AND SAVE THE DPKZ AND IF WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT IN THIS YEAR OR THE YEAR THAT FOLLOWS THEN UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION OUR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL PURSUE THESE FACTS AND ENSURE THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND JUSTICE. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE SAVE THIS COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN DELANEY BECAUSE OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES THAT CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE WAS ZRIBING THERE AND THE REAL POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN WHICH NANCY PELOSI IS SAYING THAT IMPEACHMENT WILL NOT BE PURSUED IN THE HOUSE. IT RAISES THE PROSPECT AND THE MUELLER REPORT RAISES THE PROSPECT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD BE PROSECUTED FOR SOME POTENTIAL CRIMES DOWN THE LINE. NO U.S. PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN PROSECUTED FOR CRIMES AFTER LEAVING OFFICE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD OR SHOULD BE THE FIRST? &gt;&gt; I GUESS THERE IS ALWAYS A FIRST. &gt;&gt; SHOULD HE BE THE FIRST. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS ABOVE THE LAW INCLUDING A THE PRESIDENT. I SUPPORT SPEAKER PELOSI'S DECISIONS SHE IS MAKING IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES RIGHT NOW AS SPEAKER. I THINK SHE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT THAN ANY OF THE 2020 CANDIDATES COMBINED. &gt;&gt; CONCEDED. &gt;&gt; BUT I DO THINK -- I DO THINK -- NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW AND THIS PRESIDENT WHO IS LAWLESS SHOULD NOT BE ABOVE THE LAW. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, RACHEL, THE ONE THING WHEN YOU ARE OUT DOING AS MUCH CAMPAIGNING AS I HAVE DONE, FOUR HUNDRED EVENTS ALL 99 COUNTIES IN IOWA THIS IS NOT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASK ABOUT. IT'S NOT. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR HEALTH CARE. LOWER PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES HOW WE BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT WE DO TO CREATE JOBS IN THE COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR IN OUR COUNTRY 80% OF THE MONEY FOR START-UP BUSINESSES WENT TO 50 COUNTIES IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS OVER 3,000 COUNTIES IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT. THEY CARE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THEY CARE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH JOBS IN THE COMMUNITIES WITH THEIR PAY, WITH THEIR HEALTH CARE WITH INFRASTRUCTURE, THESE ARE THE ISSUES AT THE KITCHEN TABLE POCKETBOOK ISSUES ARE WHAT MOST AMERICANS CARE ABOUT. THEY NEVER ASKED ABOUT THE MUELLER REPORT. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN. &gt;&gt; THEY NEVER ASK ABOUT IT THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW WE ARE TOFLG THESE PROGRAMS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE OUT OF TIME. &gt;&gt; SENATOR, WE GOT -- &gt;&gt; WE LET THE REPUBLICANS LUN RUN OUR ELECTION F2 WE DO NOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION AND WE LET MITCH McCONNELL STOP ALL THE BACK UP PAPER BALLOTS WE ARE NOT GETTING WHAT WE WANT. &gt;&gt; I GOT A SNEAKING -- WE BLEW THROUGH A BREAK WHICH IS GOOD NEWS TO GIVE YOU MORE TIME. I GOT TO SNEAK ONE IN NOW. MORE OF THIS DEBATE PICKING UP HERE. IT CONTINUES RIGHT AFTER THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ &gt;&gt;&gt; DON'T MISS NIGHT TWO OF THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE AS TEN MORE CANDIDATES BATTLE IT OUT. TOMORROW AT 9:00 EASTERN ON NBC, [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt;&gt; WE ARE BACK FOR MIAMI. IT'S TIME NOW FOR CLOSING STATEMENTS. EACH CANDIDATE HAS 45 SECONDS. WE WANT TO BEGIN WITH FORMER CONGRESSMAN DELANEY. &gt;&gt; CLOSING NOW. &gt;&gt; CLOSING 45 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; WE CAN MAKE -- WE CAN GO ON. &gt;&gt; TOGETHER WE ARE ON A MISSION. WE'RE ON A MISSION TO FINE THE AMERICA THAT'S BEEN LOST, LOST THROUGH INFIGHTING, LOST THROUGH INACTION, WE'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE'RE A COUNTRY THAT USED TO DO THINGS. WE SAVED THE WORLD. WE CREATED THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR MINNEAPOLIS OF PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. THE GRANDSON OF IMMIGRANTS, THE SON OF A UNION ELECTRICIAN WHO WENT ON TO BECOME A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS LEADER AND CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS. BUT WE DID THESE THINGS WITH REAL SOLUTIONS. NOT WITH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES. AND THOSE ARE THE ROOTS THAT WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE, TO FIX OUR BROKEN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, TO INVEST IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND, TO IMPROVE PUBLIC EDUCATION. I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT TO BE. &gt;&gt; YOUR 45 SECONDS IS OVER. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO DO YOUR PRESIDENT TO DO THE JOB. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, ZBLIER THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME THIS IS ABOUT GETTING AMERICA WORKING AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; MAYOR DE BLASIO. MAYOR YOUR CLOSING STATEMENT. &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS. IT MATTERS IN THIS FIGHT FOR THE HEART AND SOUL OF OUR PARTY THAT WE NOMINATE A CANDIDATE WHO HAS SEEN THE FACE OF POVERTY AND DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT BUT GAVE PEOPLE $15 MINIMUM WAGE. IT MATTERS THAT WE NOMINATE A CANDIDATE WHO SAW THE DESTRUCTION WROUGHT BY BROKEN HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND GAVE PEOPLE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. IT MATTERS THAT WE CHOOSE SOMEONE WHO SAW THE WASTED POTENTIAL OF OUR CHILDREN DENIED PREK AND GAVE IT TO EVERY ONE OF THEM FOR FREE. THESE THINGS REALLY MATTER. AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE IN NEW YORK AND I WANT TO DO THE SAME FOR THIS WHOLE COUNTRY. BECAUSE PUTTING WORKING PEOPLE FIRST, IT MATTERS. WE NEED TO TO BE THAT PARTY AGAIN. LET'S WORK TOGETHER, WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN PUT WORKING PEOPLE FIRST AGAIN IN AMERICA. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU MAYOR GLASS YES. &gt;&gt; GOVERNOR INSLEE, 45 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; I HAVE THREE GRAND CHILDREN WE LOVE THEM ALL. WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHETHER TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT I MADE A DECISION. I DECIDED THAT ON MY LAST DAY I WANTED TO LOOK THEM IN THE EYE AND TELL THEM I DID EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE RAF AJS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND I KNOW TO A MORAL CERTAINTY THAT IF WE DO NOT HAVE THE NEXT PRESIDENT WHO COMMITS TO THIS AS THE TOP PRIORITY IT WON'T GET DONE. AND "I" THE ONLY CANDIDATE -- FRANKLY I'M SURPRISED -- I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE MAKING THIS COMMITMENT TO MAKE IT THE TOP PRIORITY. IF YOU JOIN ME IN THAT RECOGNITION OF HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS, WE CAN HAVE A UNIFIED NATIONAL MISSION. WE CAN SAVE OURSELVES. WE CAN CAN SAVE OUR INNER CHILDREN. WE CAN SAVE OUR GRANDCHILDREN. AND WE CAN SAVE LITERALLY THE LIFE ON THIS PLANET. THIS IS YOU ARE MOMENT. &gt;&gt; GOVERNOR, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN RYAN, YOUR 40 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN NOT BEING HEARD. NOTHING WORSE THAN NOT BEING SEEN. AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I'VE REPRESENTED FOR 17 YEARS IN CONGRESS THE FORGOTTEN COMMUNITY. THEY'VE TRIED TO DIVIDE US, WHO IS WHITE, BLACK, WHITE, GAY, STRAIGHT, MAN, WOMAN. THEY RAN AWAY WITH ALL THE GOLD. BECAUSE THEY DIVIDED THE WORKING CLASS. IT'S TIME FOR US TO COME TOGETHER. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. BUT I'M READY TO PLAY SOME OFFENSE. I COME FROM THE MIDDLE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA. BUT THESE PROBLEMS ARE ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. THERE IS A TENT TENT CITY IN L.A. HOMELESS PEOPLE AND PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO CAN'T AFFORD A HOME. IT'S TIME TO GET BACK ON TRACK. THE TEACHER IN TEXAS, THE NURSE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE WAITRESS IN WISCONSIN, ALL OF US COMING TOGETHER. PLAYING OFFENSE WITH AN AGENDA THAT LIFTS EVERYBODY UP. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; I WILL ONLY PROPTDS YOU ONE THING WHEN I WALK IN THE OVAL OFFICE EVERY MORE THAN YOU WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; YOUR VOICE WILL BE HEARD. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSWOMAN GABD GABBARD YOU HAVE 45 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; OUR NATION WAS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SERVICE ABOVE SEVEN. PEOPLE WHO FLED KINGS, LITERALLY PROSPERSED ON THE BACKS OF THE SACRIFICES OF PEOPLE COMING HERE TO THIS COUNTRY, INSTEAD PUTTING IN PLACE A GOVERNMENT THAT IS OF, BY AND FOR THE PEOPLE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE. INSTEAD WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT IS OF, BY AND FOR THE RICH AND POWERFUL. THIS MUST END. AS PRESIDENT, OUR WHITE HOUSE, OUR WHITE HOUSE WILL BE A BEACON OF LIGHT PROVIDING HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY, USHERING IN A NEW CENTURY WHERE EVERY SINGLE PERSON WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. WHERE WE WILL HAVE CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE AND CLEAN WATER TO DRINK. WE WILL HAVE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND A NEW GREEN ECONOMY. JOIN ME IN USHERING IN THIS THIS NEW CENTURY PEACE, PROSPERITY, OPPORTUNITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE 45 SECONDS, SIR. &gt;&gt; [ SPEAKING SPANISH ]. &gt;&gt; THE VERY FACT THAT I CAN SAY THAT TONIGHT SHOWS THE PRG THAT WE HAVE MADE IN THIS COUNTRY. LIKE MANY OF YOU I KNOW THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. MY GRANDMOTHER CAME MERE WHEN SHE WAS 7 YEARS OLD A AS OF AN IMMIGRANT FROM MEXICO AND TWO GENERATIONS LATER ONE OF HERP GRANDSONS IS SERVING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND THE OTHER ONE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT I WILL WORK HARD EVERY DAY SO THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY CAN GET GOOD HEALTH CARE. YOUR CHILD CAN GET A GOOD EDUCATION AND YOU CAN HAVE GOOD JOB OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER LIVING IN A SMALL TOWN OR BIG CITY. AND ON JANUARY 20th, 2021 WE'LL SAY ADIOS TO DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, THE FLOOR IS YOURS. &gt;&gt; THREE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT ME. FIRST, I LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND THAT'S HOW I GET THINGS DONE. THAT'S MY FOCUS. I HAVE A TRACT RECORD OF PASSING OVER 100 BILLS WHERE I'M THE LEAD DEMOCRATIC BECAUSE I LISTEN, AND I ACT. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT IN A PRESIDENT. EVERYTHING ELSE JUST MELTS AWAY. SECONDLY, I'M SOMEONE THAT CAN WIN AND BEAT DONALD TRUMP. I HAVE WON EVERY PLACE, EVERY RACE AND EVERY TIME. I HAVE WON IN THE REDDEST DISTRICTS ONES THAT DONALD TRUMP WON BY OVER 20 POINTS. I CAN WIN IN STATES LIKE WISCONSIN AND IOWA AND IN MICHIGAN. AND FINALLY, YEAH, I AM NOT THE ESTABLISHMENT PARTY CANDIDATE. I'VE GOT RESPECT BUT I'M IN THE THAT PERSON. I AM THE ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A POLITICAL MACHINE THAT DOESN'T COME FROM MONEY. ABOUT AND I DON'T MAKE ALL THE PROMISES EVERYONE UP HERE MAKES. I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS. I'M GOVERNING WITH INTEGRITY. I'M GOING TO HAVE YOUR BACK. AND I'M GOING TO OREGON FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR. &gt;&gt; 50 YEARS AGO THIS MONTH MY FAMILY MOVED INTO THE TOWN I GREW UP BECAUSE AFTER BEING DEFIED A HOUSE BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN WAS IT WAS WHITE ACTIVISTS THAT STOOD UP AND FOUGHT FOR THEM. PEACE THAT'S THE BEST WHO WE ARE AT MARK WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL I FIGHT AS A TENANT LAWYER TO FIGHT FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. I'VE TAKEN ON BULLIES AND WE HAVE ONE. WE WIN NOT BY BECOMING THE WORST OF WHO WE ARE BUT THE BEST. DONALD TRUMP WANTS US TO FIGHT HIM ON HIS TURF AND HIS TERMS. I WILL BEAT HIM BY CALLING THIS COUNTRY TO A SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE AGAIN. THIS IS A REFERENDUM ON HIM AND GETTING RID OF HIM BUT ALSO A REFRPD UP ON US, WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MUST BE TO EACH OTHER. IT'S TIME WE WIN THIS ELECTION AND THE WAY I WILL GOVERN IS BY SHOWING THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE 45 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; MY DAUGHTER MOLLIE TURNED 11 THIS WEEK. I'M ON THIS STAGE FOR HER FOR CHILDREN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. INCLUDING SOME HER SAME AGE SEPARATED FROM HER PARENTS AND SLEEPING ON CONCRETE FLOORS UNDER ALUMINUM BLANKETS TONIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM WE'RE GOING TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. WE CAN'T RETURN FOR THE SAME OLD APPROACH. WE'RE GOING TO NEED A NEW KIND OF POLITICS, ONE DIRECTED BY THE URGENCY OF THE NEXT GENERATION. THOSE CLIMATE ACTIVISTS FIGHTING NOT JUST FOR THEIR FUTURE BUT FOR EVERYONE. THE STUDENTS MARCHING NOT JUST FOR THEIR LIVES BUT ALL OF OURS. WE NEED A MOVEMENT LIKE THE ONE WE LED IN TEXAS, RENEWING OUR DEMOCRACY BY BRINGING EVERYONE IN AND WRITING NOBODY OFF. THAT'S HOW WE BEAT DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S HOW WE BRING IN GREAT COUNTRY TOGETHER AGAIN. JOIN US. THIS IS OUR MOMENT. AND THE GENERATIONS THAT FOLLOW ARE COUNTING ON US TO MEET IT. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN. &gt;&gt; SENATOR WARREN YOU HAVE 45 SECONDS FOR THIS FINAL, FINAL STATEMENT OF THE EVENING. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE. NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS DID I THINK I WOULD STAND ON A STAGE LIKE THIS. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN OKLAHOMA. I HAVE THREE OLDER BROTHERS. THEY ALL JOIN THE MILITARY. I HAD A DREAM GROWING UP. AND MY DREAM WAS TO BE A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER. BY THE TIME I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL MY FAMILY MY FAMILY DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR COLLEGE APPLICATION MUCH LESS A CHANCE FOR ME TO GO TO COLLEGE. BUT I GOT MY CHANCE. IT WAS A $50 A SEMESTER COMMUTER COLLEGE. THAT WAS A LITTLE SLICE OF GOVERNMENT THAT CREATED SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR A GIRL. AND IT OPENED MY LIFE. I AM IN THIS FIGHT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR GOVERNMENT. WE CAN MAKE OUR ECONOMY. WE CAN MAKE OUR COUNTRY WORK. NOT JUST FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. WE CAN MAKE IT WORK FOR EVERYONE. AND I PROMISE YOU THIS. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU AS HARD AS I FIGHT FOR MY OWN FAMILY. &gt;&gt; THAT WILL WILL DO IT FOR NIGHT ONE OF THIS TWO-NIGHT EVENT. AND GUESS WHAT, WE HAVE TEN MORE CANDIDATES TOMORROW NIGHT. &gt;&gt; WE CERTAINLY HOPE YOU JOIN US THEN. BUT FOR NOW THAT CONCLUDES OUR COVERAGE OF THIS FIRST DEMOCRATIC DEBATE FROM MIAMI. FOR US JOSE, CHUCK AND RACHEL, I'M LESTER HOLTE. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] . &gt;&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. I'M MORGAN RADFORD AND WELCOME TO SPECIAL POST DEBATE COVERAGE OF THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC DEBATE OF THE TO 20 ELECTION CYCLE RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW. WE JUST WRAPPED UP NIGHT ONE OF THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC DEBATE AND WE'VE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. THE TOP FOUR FRONT RUNNERS GOING INTO TONIGHT WIN THE TOP FIVE FOR THE MOST AIR TIME. ELIZABETH WARREN, CORY BOOKER, BETO O'ROURKE. ALSO IN THE TOP FIVE WAS JULIAN CASTRO. NOT SURPRISINGLY, IT WAS A NIGHT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT THE ISSUES. WE HEARD FROM CANDIDATES ON THINGS LIKE IMMIGRATION, FREE COLLEGE, HEALTH CARE, THE IRAN DEAL, ABORTION, GUN VIOLENCE, THE SUPREME COURT, CLIMATE CHANGE, POLICE VIOLENCE AND OF COURSE LGBTQ RIGHTS. SO TO BREAK DOWN WHAT WE SAW THIS EVENING WE'RE BRINGING OUR PANEL BACK IN. WE HAVE REPUBLICAN POLITICAL CONSULTANT SIR MICHAEL SINGLETON. POLITICAL REPORTER ALEX THOMPSON AND MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST SELENA MAXWELL. THEY'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE HIGHLIGHTS. ALEX, DID ANYTHING SURPRISE YOU? &gt;&gt; PROBABLY THE MOST SURPRISING NIGHT, HIS ABILITY TO HAVE HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF CERTAIN POLICY ISSUES. I THINK HE REALLY CAUGHT BETO O'ROURKE OFF GUARD BY KIND OF HITTING HIM FROM THE LEFT ON THIS QUESTION ABOUT IS IT A CRIME TO CROSS THE BORDER. CLEARLY SECRETARY CASTRO HAD DONE PREP WORK. HE KNEW BETO'S RECORD SPECIFICALLY, SO HE ENTERED THE NIGHT PREPARED TO ATTACK BETO ON THAT ISSUE, AND BETO DID NOT -- &gt;&gt; HE GOT VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT REPEALING SECTION 1325 AND SAYING LET'S NOT JUST FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON ASYLUM. IT IS ALSO INTERESTING BECAUSE IF YOU LOOKED AT GOOGLE, THEY SAID THAT THE GOOGLE SEARCH FOR JULIAN CASTRO INCREASED 2400% AND THAT WAS JUST SINCE THE DEBATE STARTED. SO, MICHAEL, IS HE THE BREAK OUT? &gt;&gt; I SAID IT EARLIER, I'M GLAD I DID. I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE THE GUY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS, HE WAS ABLE TO DO WHAT I WOULD ARGUE ELIZABETH WARREN DIDN'T EVEN DO AS EFFECTIVELY AS I THOUGHT SHE COULD. TALK ABOUT VERY DETAILED POLICIES IN A WAY WHERE THE AVERAGE PERSON WATCHING, I DID THIS. THIS MAKES SENSE AND I KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT ME. THIS IS A GREAT NIGHT FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK WE SAW ELIZABETH WARREN BROUGHT THE PASSION, BUT CASTRO SEEMED TO REALLY BRING THE POLICY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. I MEAN, IT'S TOUGH IN 60 SECONDS TO DO BOTH, RIGHT? AND I THINK THAT HE PREPARED FOR EXACTLY THAT. I ALSO THINK HE HAD THE BENEFIT OF PEOPLE NOT NECESSARILY KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS BROTHER. &gt;&gt; JOAQUIN. &gt;&gt; IT'S FUNNY, BUT PEOPLE WERE LIKE THIS IS JULIAN AND THIS IS WHAT HE'S ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE NEW TO PEOPLE, I THINK THAT IT'S ACTUALLY YOU HAVE LOW EXPECTATIONS AND YOU CAN SURPASS THEM, WHEREAS ELIZABETH WARREN WENT IN WITH SKY HIGH EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN RISING TO THE DOUBLE DIGITS INTO THE TOP TIER. SO I THINK THEY HAD DIFFERENT CHALLENGES, AND I THINK THAT HER PASSION DID COME THROUGH. &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T NECESSARILY NEED SUBSTANCE IN THIS DEBATE. SHE HAS THAT AS HER TAG LINE. I HAVE A POINT FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SHE MOVED THE NEEDLE AS MUCH AS SHE COULD HAVE. &gt;&gt; COULD HAVE. MAYBE NOT SHOULD HAVE -- &gt;&gt; LOOK, LET'S BE HONEST. HER GOAL AND OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE TO BE ON THE SAME DEBATE STAGE AS BERNIE SANDERS AND JOE BIDEN, MAYOR PETE, AS KAMALA HARRIS. I'M NOT NECESSARILY SURE THAT WE'LL SEE A FIVE OR TEN-POINT BUMP FROM HER PERFORMANCE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHY, WHAT DID SHE NOT DO? &gt;&gt; LOOK, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE ANTICIPATING A LOT OF ENERGY COMING FROM ELIZABETH WARREN. I WOULD ARGUE YOU SAW MORE ENERGY COMING FROM MAYOR BILL De BLASIO THAN YOU DID FROM ELIZABETH WARREN. EXACTLY, HE REALLY DID. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SORT OF SAW HER, SHE'S THE FRONT RUNNER ON THAT STAGE TONIGHT AMONG ALL THOSE COMPETITORS AND SHE DIDN'T, IN MY OPINION, QUITE MEET THE MARK AS FAR AS EXPECTATIONS THAT I HAD SET FOR HER FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS. &gt;&gt; WHY IS THAT? &gt;&gt; THEY WERE HIGH EXPECTATIONS. SHE'S IN THE CENTER OF THE STAGE. ALL THE FIRE IS AIMED AT HER. SO ALL SHE HAS -- I FEEL LIKE ALL SHE HAD TO DO TONIGHT WAS NOT MESS UP. WHEN YOU HAVE MOMENTUM IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, THAT CAN CONTINUE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T HAVE A MAJOR SCREW UP OR GAFF. &gt;&gt; ALEX, I WANT TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS. WHEN I POSTED THE QUESTION TO TWITTER ABOUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR, RAYMOND D. SAID DID ANY CANDIDATE MISS THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO STAND OUT? &gt;&gt; I THINK AMY KLOBUCHAR DID FAIL. I THINK GOVERNOR INSLEE FAILED. I THINK THEY BOTH HAD THEIR LITTLE MOMENTS. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUSH IT FORWARD, BUT THEY ARE IN THIS SORT OF TIER WHERE THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN QUALIFY FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF DEBATES IN SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER. THEY NEED MOMENTS IN ORDER TO CATCH FIRE IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH THE 130,000 MARK. I THINK AMY KLOBUCHAR COULD HAVE A MOMENT WHERE SHE SAID MAN SCREENING. &gt;&gt; SHE SAID WOMEN HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES A VERY LONG TIME. &gt;&gt; SHE ACTED LIKE SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE. &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? &gt;&gt; IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE MY QUESTION WAS WHAT ABOUT THE IDENTITY TONIGHT? I THINK WE ALL HAD THE MOMENT WHENWAY SAW BETO CAME OUT AND HE WAS SPEAKING SPANISH. CORY BOOKER SPOKE SPANISH. IT WASN'T THAT BECAUSE BEYOND THE SPANISH, WE ALSO SAW THAT CORY BOOKER SPOKE EXPLICITLY ABOUT HIS CONNECTION TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY. De BLASIO SAID, BY THE WAY, I HAVE A BLACKSON WHO IS NAMED DANTE. HE MADE A CONNECTION. DID IT WORK? DID THEY REACH INTO THEIR IDENTITY? &gt;&gt; IT WAS LIKE PANDERING 102. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU DID NOT LIKE THAT? &gt;&gt; NO, I DID NOT. WHEN JULIAN DID IT HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICANS. I NOTICED THAT. THE SAME THING ABOUT CORY BOOKER. EXACTLY. DID YOU NOT SEE THE EXPRESSIONS ONCORY BOOKER -- &gt;&gt; THEY CAME IN -- &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND ELIZABETH WARREN. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE LOOKING AT HIM LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; I THINK THE REASON WHY IS HE JUMPED RIGHT TO IT, RIGHT? IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS, HI, I'M BETO. HE JUMPED RIGHT TO THE SPANISH. PEOPLE WHO KNOW SPANISH ON TWITTER ARE LIKE, YOU DIDN'T EVEN ANSWER THE QUESTION IN SPANISH. SO -- &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO ASK -- DO THAT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; I FELT HE DID. THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN MY PHONE STARTED BLOWING UP. MY MOM IS LIKE, OH, WOW -- YEAH, THIS IS WILD. FOR ME I WAS TRYING TO THINK WHEN HAVE WE SEEN SOMEONE DO IT TO THAT DEGREE OF FLUIDITY? I FELT IT WAS A MARK OF INCLUSION. &gt;&gt; IT WAS PRETTY GOOD, SPANISH HE'S FLUENT. I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT WAS A GOOD THING THAT HE WAS DOING THAT AND THAT THEY WERE PLAYING OFF OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS FLUENT IN SPANISH. I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY PLAYING IDENTIT POLITICS IN A WAY THAT CAN APPEAR LIKE PANDERING IS A GOOD THING. I THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO IT IT THAT IS COMPLETELY AUTHENTIC. YOU CAN SHOW UP AND SAY I'M A WHITE GUY NAMED ROBERTO ROURKE AND THEN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BUT YOU DON'T -- I THINK, YOU KNOW, HE BENEFITS IN THE FACT HIS NICKNAME IS BETO. HE BENEFITS FROM THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE LOOKING AT HIM MAY NOT KNOW HE'S A WHITE MAN NAMED ROBERT. &gt;&gt; TO BE CLEAR, IN SPANISH BETO IS THE SHORT FOR ROBERTO. &gt;&gt; HE GREW UP IN TEXAS, KNOWN AS BETO. HE AUTHENTICALLY HAS AN EXPERIENCE AND CONNECTION WITH THAT COMMUNITY. BUT, ALEX, WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU HEARD De BLASIO TALK ABOUT HIS SON, WHAT DID YOU THINK? &gt;&gt; I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST MOMENTS OF THE DEBATE. HE ACTUALLY WAS MAYBE NOT AS BIG OF A STAR AS JULIAN, BUT CERTAINLY A BREAK-OUT STAR OF THIS DEBATE. I THINK HE REALLY RESONATED. WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ON PRIVATE INSURANCE OR IDENTITY OR TALKING ABOUT HIS FATHER'S SUICIDE, WHICH I THINK, YOU KNOW, HE HAD A FEW GOOD MOMENTS THAT I THINK REALLY WOULD RESONATE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC BASE. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL, LET ME GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE, TOO, ONCORY BOOKER BECAUSE CORY BOOKER SPOKE VERY CANDIDLY ABOUT BEING AFRICAN-AMERICAN. FREQUENTLY SAID, MY COMMUNITY, MY COMMUNITY. DO YOU THINK HE MADE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT HE COULD BE EVERYONE'S PRESIDENT? &gt;&gt; I THINK SO. FROM CORY BOOKER'S PERSPECTIVE, HE MENTIONED WHEN HIS PARENTS MOVED INTO A CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOOD, IT WAS WHITE ACTIVISTS THAT CAME TO HIS PARENTS' DEFENSE, IF YOU WILL. I THINK HE DID TRY TO BRING TWO DIFFERENT COALITIONS TOGETHER. TO BE HONEST, I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT MORE CANDIDATES DID NOT SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY ON GUN VIOLENCE. WHEN THEY DID, THEY SPOKE ABOUT ASSAULT RIFLES, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, MOST GUN VIOLENCE IS BY PISTOL. I WAS ALSO DISAPPOINTED THAT NONE OF THE CANDIDATES SEEMED TO BE PREPARED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION DIRECTLY ABOUT HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH MITCH McCONNELL CONTROLLING THE SENATE? THESE ARE SOME GREAT IDEAS -- &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH WARREN DID ADDRESS IT. &gt;&gt; I THINK SHE TALKED AROUND IT. SHE DIDN'T DIRECTLY ANSWER IT. THESE ARE GREAT IDEAS, BUT THE REALITY IS IF YOU GET ELECTED NEXT YEAR, MITCH McCONNELL IS STILL THE MAJORITY LEADER. NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO COME TO FRUITION. &gt;&gt; AFTER -- &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT MORE TO TALK ABOUT HERE. AND WE HEARD FROM THE CANDIDATES ABOUT WHERE THEY STAND ON IMMIGRATION, COLLEGE, HEALTH CARE, ABORTION AND MANY OTHER ISSUES. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE HIGHLIGHTS. &gt;&gt; A NEW DEMOCRACY THAT IS REVIVED BECAUSE WE RETURN POWER TO THE PEOPLE, NO GERRYMANDERING. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE NEW THING? IT'S COURAGE. COURAGE IN WASHINGTON TO TAKE ON THE GIANTS. &gt;&gt; I WOULD DO SEVERAL THINGS, STARTING WITH SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO WHICH IS TO PASS THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT. WHO HERE WOULD ABOLISH THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IN FAVOR OF A GOVERNMENT-RUN PLAN, A SHOW OF HANDS? [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. WELL, IT SHOULD NOT BE AN OPTION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR ANY INSURANCE COMPANY TO DENY WOMEN COVERAGE FOR THEIR EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHT OF CHOICE. &gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO SAY THERE ARE THREE WOMEN UP HERE WHO HAVE FOUGHT PRETTY HARD FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS. &gt;&gt; ALL THE AMERICAN CITIZENS OUT THERE WHO FEEL YOU'RE FALLING BEHIND, THE AMERICAN DREAM IS NOT WORKING FOR YOU, THE IMMIGRANTS DIDN'T DO THAT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK WE CONDUCT ONE POLICY IN OUR BATH ROBE AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING. &gt;&gt; IF YOU NEED A LICENSE TO DRIVE A CAR, YOU SHOULD NEED A LICENSE TO BUY AND OWN A FIREARM. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO TREAT IT LIKE A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT WE BRING TO BEAR AND IT MEANS MAKING REAL CHAIR IN THIS COUNTRY WHETHER IT'S POLITICALLY POPULAR OR NOT. &gt;&gt; MY FIRST VISIT, AFTER I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY WASN'T TO IOWA OR NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT WAS TO SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO. [ APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, EVERYBODY WILL COUNT. &gt;&gt; I SERVE WITH LGBTQ SERVICE MEMBERS, BOTH IN TRAINING AND DEPLOYED DOWN RANGE. I KNOW THAT THEY WOULD GIVE THEIR LIFE FOR ME AND I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT WILL FIGHT TO PROTECT LGBTQ AMERICANS EVERY SINGLE DAY. &gt;&gt; ON JANUARY 20th, 2021, WE'LL SAY ADIOS TO DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; THE MAYOR OF FLORIDA IS ALSO RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BUT DID NOT QUALIFY TO BE ON THE DEBATE STAGE TONIGHT WITH THE OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES HOPING TO CHALLENGE PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020. HE JOINS US NOW LIVE FROM MIRAMAR, FLORIDA TO SHARE HIS PERSPECTIVE. MAYOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS EVENING AND SHARING YOUR TIME WITH US. WHAT WAS YOUR INITIAL REACTION TO TONIGHT'S DEBATE? DID ANYTHING SURPRISE YOU? &gt;&gt; WELL, NO. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR SOMETIME NOW. JUST HEARING SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES IS PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE MESSAGES WE'VE HEARD ON THE CAMPAIGN. &gt;&gt; AND SPEAKING OF THAT, YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR SOME MONTHS NOW. WHEN YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE, YOU'VE BEEN TALKING SPECIFICALLY TO GUN CONTROL AND TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE ELIMINATING THE STUDENT DEBT. DID YOU AGREE WITH THE CANDIDATES' POINTS ON THOSE ISSUES? WAS THERE ANY ONE YOU FELT REALLY WAS ALIGNED WITH WHAT YOUR VISION IS? &gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK MY MESSAGE IS MORE UNIQUE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT IN DETAIL. GUN VIOLENCE MENTIONED EARLIER, WE HIGHLIGHT MASS SHOOTING, BUT EVERY DAY THERE IS NEIGHBORHOOD GUN VIOLENCE THAT TAKES PLACE AND WE NEED MORE SOLUTIONS DEALING WITH JUST THE PLIGHT OF WHAT DRIVES THOSE TYPE OF DECISIONS TO KILL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. I THINK AS CANDIDATES, WE HAVE TO COME SPECIFICALLY TO DEAL WITH THESE EVERYDAY ISSUES. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT IS YOUR SPECIFIC SOLUTION TO THE GUN VIOLENCE ISSUE? &gt;&gt; WELL, THE FIRST THING IN TERMS OF EVERYDAY VIOLENCE, YOU HAVE TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS OF EVERYDAY AMERICANS. WHERE THEY HAVE HOPE, THEY HAVE TUBTS FOR PROSPERITY SO THEY'RE NOT TURNING TO A LIFE OF CRIME THAT LEADS TO VIOLENCE. AND I THINK WHEN WE IMPROVE THE DAILY LIVES OF AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY IN THE URBAN COMMUNITIES AND AREAS WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF GUN VIOLENCE, WE'LL SEE A REDUCTION. IT'S MORE THAN JUST TAKING GUNS OFF THE STREET. IT'S REALLY TAKING AND GIVING THEM EDUCATION, GIVING THEM OPPORTUNITIES, AND GIVING THEM AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN SUCCEED. &gt;&gt; AND IS THERE ANYTHING BESIDES THE GUN CONTROL ISSUE THAT YOU SPECIFICALLY FEEL LIKE YOU COULD HAVE BROUGHT TO THE DEBATE STAGE TONIGHT IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY? &gt;&gt; WELL, ONE THING -- HERE'S A COUPLE THINGS. FIRST, I WOULD HAVE DEALT MORE IN TERMS OF THE STUDENT LOAN CRISIS, BEING THE FIRST CANDIDATE TO MAKE THAT PROPOSAL TO FORGIVE THE $1.5 TRILLION, I WOULD HAVE GONE INTO THOSE ISSUES, MAKE NOTES HOW OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE ALSO FOLLOWED THAT LEAD AND HOW IT WOULD BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS WHO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE WITH THE CRIPPLING DEBT. THE OTHER THING IS ABOUT WINNING. WE HAVE TO ATTRACT AND MOTIVATE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WHO FEEL DISENCHANTED. IN ALL CANDOR, IF WE'RE NOT SPEAKING TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT FEEL LIKE WE HAVE SOLUTIONS FOR THEM, WE WILL IMPROVE THEIR LIVES, THAT THE SYSTEM CAN BE TILTED BACK IN THEIR FAVOR INSTEAD OF, YOU KNOW, RICH CORPORATIONS AND THE RICH EST OF AMERICANS. LIKE MY STATE OF FLORIDA. ELECTIONS ARE DETERMINED BY 20, 30,000 VOTES AND THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT BASICALLY JUST STAY HOME. WHEN YOU HAVE 100,000 REGISTERED VOTERS THAT JUST STAY HOME BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T MOTIVATED, IN FLORIDA THAT IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL AND WE HAVE TO SPEAK TO THOSE VOTERS. &gt;&gt; SO, MAYOR, I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. I HAVE TO BE HONEST, WHEN I WAS WALKING IN TO DO THIS SHOW, SOMEONE STOPPED ME IN THE HALLWAY. MORGAN, AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. THEY ASKED ME, IF I COULD SPEAK TO THE CANDIDATES, IS THERE ANYONE THEY WOULD SUPPORT IF THEIR ANSWER WAS NOT -- IS THERE ANYONE BASED ON THEIR PERFORMANCE YOU THINK YOU COULD GET BEHIND? &gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE DEBATES AND DISCUSSIONS THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR A LOT OF MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS THAT ARE SEEKING THE NOMINATION AND ANY OF US WOULD BE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP. SO I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO BEAT THAT FROM THE QUESTIONS OF THE MODERATOR AFTER QUALIFYING FOR ONE OF THE DEBATES ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. &gt;&gt; MAYOR FROM MIRAMAR, FLORIDA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING. &gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING ME. &gt;&gt; OUR PLEASURE. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK, BUT STICK WITH US. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. &gt;&gt;&gt; THE GLOVES CAME OFF TONIGHT AS TEN OF THE 25 DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS TOOK TO THE STAGE DEBATING TOPICS LIKE HEALTH CARE, IMMIGRATION, AND GUNS. BUT HOW MANY OF THEIR CLAIMS WERE TRUE? NBC IN MIAMI HAS BEEN FACT CHECKING. WHAT DID YOU FIND? &gt;&gt; WE WERE TYPING AWAY. EVERY CLAIM, EVERY NUMBER THAT CAME ACROSS OUR DESK. THREE THINGS I WANTED TO BRING UP, WE SAW JULIAN CASTRO TALKED ABOUT FATHER AND DAUGHTER, TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES. IT IS TRUE, THE PRESIDENT HAS INSTITUTED WITH HIS ADMINISTRATION POLICIES THAT SLOW THE NUMBER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS THAT CAN ENTER THE COUNTRY EACH DAY AND CLAIM ASYLUM. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ACCORDING TO THE REPORTING IN MEXICO IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MOTIVATED THIS FATHER TO RISK HIS LIFE AND CROSS THE RIO GRAND WHEN HE WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED. &gt;&gt;&gt; A COUPLE OTHER THINGS THAT CAME ACROSS MY DESK THAT WERE INTERESTING. AMY KLOBUCHAR BROUGHT UP THE IMMIGRATION BILL. SOMETHING WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YEARS AGO AND SAID IT LOWERS THE DEBT. SHE'S CLOSE. IT LOWERS THE DEFICIT. IT DOES LOWER THE DEBT, BUT DOESN'T TICK DOWN THE DEBT THE SAME WAY. THE DEBT RISES AT A SLOWER RATE THAN IT WOULD BEFORE. THE BIG FALSEHOOD OF THE NIGHT, THE BIG ONE THAT I SAW WAS THE STAND OUT THING WITH FACT CHECKING WAS BETO O'ROURKE SAYING THAT PHARMA, THE MAKERS OF THE OXYCONTIN HAD TOTAL IMPUNITY AND ACTED WITHOUT ANY JUSTICE FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE NARCOTICS AND OPIOID CRISIS. THE COMPANY HAS PAID HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SETTLEMENTS. THEY'RE IN COURT CONSTANTLY FIGHTING OFF THESE CLAIMS. HE SAID THEY NEVER SPENT A NIGHT IN JAIL. THAT'S CORRECT. THE OVERALL CLAIM OF IMPUNITY NOT EXACTLY RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WOW, THAT'S A LOT. BIG PHARMA, THE DEFICIT VERSUS DEBT, AS WELL AS IMMIGRATION. THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING. AS JANE MENTIONED, IMMIGRATION WAS IN FOCUS TONIGHT, A VERY HOT TOPIC, AND IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF A HEATED DEBATE ON STAGE WE SAW BETWEEN BETO O'ROURKE AND JULIAN CASTRO. THEY CLASHED OVER THEIR IMMIGRATION STANCES AND OTHER CANDIDATES WEIGHED IN WITH THEIR OWN OPINIONS. HERE ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS. &gt;&gt; WATCHING THAT IMAGE OF THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER IS HEART BREAKING. IT SHOULD ALSO PURSE US ALL OFF. IF I WAS PRESIDENT TODAY, I WOULD SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WOULD GET RID OF TRUMP, ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY, THE REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY, AND THE METERING POLICY. THIS METERING POLICY IS BASICALLY WHAT PROMPTED THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER TO MAKE THAT RISKY SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER. FROM DAY ONE, I WILL MAKE SURE THAT, NUMBER ONE, WE END THE I.C.E. POLICIES AND THE CUSTOMS AND BORDER POLICIES THAT ARE VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS. I WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE REINSTATE DACA, THAT WE REINSTATE PATHWAYS TO CITIZENSHIP FOR DACA RECIPIENTS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE ON TEMPORARY STATUS CAN STAY AND REMAIN HERE. FOR ALL THE AMERICAN CITIZENS OUT THERE THAT FEEL YOU'RE FALLING BEHIND, THE AMERICAN DREAM IS NOT WORKING FOR YOU, THE IMMIGRANTS DIDN'T DO THAT TO YOU. THE BIG CORPORATIONS DID THAT TO YOU. &gt;&gt;&gt; SOME OF US ON THIS STAGE HAVE CALLED TO END THAT SECTION, TO TERMINATE IT. SOME LIKE CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE HAVE NOT. AND I WANT TO CHALLENGE ALL OF THE CANDIDATES TO DO THAT. &gt;&gt; THE NUMBER OF CONGRESS, I HELPED TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ENSURE WE DON'T CRIMINALIZE THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM AND REFUGE -- &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT -- &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A SITUATION RIGHT NOW WHERE WE NEED WORKERS IN OUR FIELDS AND IN OUR FACTORIES. WE NEED THEM TO START SMALL BUSINESSES. WE NEED THEIR IDEAS. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS LITERALLY GONE BACKWARDS AT A TIME WHERE OUR ECONOMY NEEDS IMMIGRANTS. SO MY PROPOSAL IS TO LOOK AT THAT 2013 BILL THAT PASSED THE SENATE WITH REPUBLICAN SUPPORT, TO UPGRADE THAT BILL, TO MAKE IT AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE, AND GET IT DONE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO TO GUANTANAMO BAY, THERE ARE TERRORISTS THAT ARE HELD THAT GET BETTER HEALTH CARE THAN THOSE KIDS THAT HAVE TRIED TO CROSS THE BORDER IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT NEEDS TO STOP. AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY ASK DOCTORS AND NURSES TO GO IMMEDIATELY DOWN TO THE BORDER AND START TAKING CARE OF THESE KIDS. WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ARE WE RUNNING HERE WHERE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO IS SO FOCUSED ON HATE AND FEAR AND DIVISION AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW, THE END RESULT IS NOW WE HAVE KIDS LITERALLY LAYING IN THEIR OWN SNOT WITH THREE-WEEK-OLD DIAPERS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP THE OTHER DAY TRIED TO THREATEN ME. HE SAID I WAS A THREAT, TO SAY HE WOULD SEND REFUGEES TO WASHINGTON STATE IF WE PASSED THE LAW THAT I PASSED. AND I TOLD HIM THAT'S NOT A THREAT AT ALL. WE WELCOME REFUGEES INTO OUR STATE. WE RECOGNIZE DIVERSITY AS A STRENGTH. THIS IS HOW WE BUILT AMERICA. THAT TRADITION IS GOING TO CONTINUE IF I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; SO A LOT THERE TO UNPACK TONIGHT. LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO DR. BURNES WHO IS WATCHING THE DEBATE WITH A FEW COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. GUYS, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU JUST TO START. I THOUGHT THERE WAS A REALLY POWERFUL MOMENT WHEN AMY KLOBUCHAR WAS TALKING ABOUT GUN CONTROL. SHE SAID JUST LIKE WITH GUN CONTROL AND WITH GAY RIGHTS, KIDS LEAD THE WAY. DO YOU ALL FEEL LIKE THE STUDENTS -- THE ISSUES YOU CARE ABOUT MOST WERE ADDRESSED TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE MOST OF THE ISSUES I WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT WERE ADDRESSED TONIGHT. MAYBE NOT AS DEEPLY AS I WANTED TO, BUT I AGREE WITH HER BECAUSE, YES, IT'S BEEN THE YOUTH THAT PUT THE ISSUES IN THE FOREFRONT FOR EVERYONE TO SEE AND PAY ATTENTION TO. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, THE POINT I MADE, WE WERE HAVING OUR OWN DISCUSSION REALLY, THAT WE ARE THE GENERATION THAT'S LOOKING FOR CANDIDATES TO PRESENT THEIR SPECIFIC POLICIES. AND, YES, WE DON'T WANT OVERALL GENERAL POLICIES PASSED FORWARD. AND I THINK THESE CANDIDATES WERE ABLE TO DO THAT TONIGHT. AGAIN, THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM, SO THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH TIME WE WERE ABLE TO LISTEN TO EACH PERSON, BUT I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT, YOU KNOW, CANDIDATES LIKE WARREN ALL WERE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR TIME AND LAYOUT SPECIFIC PLANS THAT THEY HAVE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY. &gt;&gt; NOW, ONE OF THE MOMENTS THAT REALLY STOOD OUT TO ME, YOU GUYS HAD A PRETTY VISCERAL REACTION TO WAS THE CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS. WARREN CALLED IT A NATIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCY. GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. WHY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT GOT A HEATED REACTION FROM YOU ALL? &gt;&gt; I THINK WE WERE ALL REALLY IMPRESSED WHEN SHE TALKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT LOOKING AT IT FROM A STANDPOINT OF DOING RESEARCH AND SEEING THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE UNDERLYING AND CAUSING THIS ISSUE IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THE WAY TO FIX THEM CORRECTLY. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE, SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE RESEARCH TO BACK THEM UP. &gt;&gt; I'M ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN THE PREVENTIVE CARE MODEL THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SEEM TO SUGGEST TONIGHT, WE WE LOOK AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ISSUE, WHETHER THAT IS GUN CONTROL OR IMMIGRATION OR HEALTH CARE. AND WE NOTICE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND THERE IS ALSO A LACK OF CARE SERVICES IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT ONE'S LIFETIME AND REALLY TERRIBLE SOCIAL ISSUES. &gt;&gt; DID YOU GET THE SPECIFICS ON THE ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IN THE DEBATE THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR? &gt;&gt; NO. MAYOR De BLASIO TALKED SPECIFICALLY HOW HE WANTS TO SHIFT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BACK TO BEING THE PARTY OF THE WORKING CLASS, BUT NEVER REALLY GAVE ANY SPECIFIC POLICY SOLUTIONS FOR IT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE BLUE COLLAR AMERICA IS HAPPENING IN PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, WISCONSIN, KEY STATES THE PRESIDENT WON IN 2016 BECAUSE HIS MESSAGE RESONATED WITH THOSE KINDS OF VOTERS. BLUE COLLAR AMERICA ISN'T HAPPENING AS MUCH IN NEW YORK CITY AS IT IS IN PLACES LIKE THAT, LIKE WEST VIRGINIA. I FELT THAT A LOT OF THE CANDIDATES SORT OF TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ELIZABETH WARREN TALKED ABOUT THE POOR PEOPLE, BUT I FELT LIKE IT WAS MORE ABOUT HELPING THEM AS POOR PEOPLE, NOT GETTING THEM BACK ON THEIR FEET, FINDING JOBS FOR THEM AND PUTTING THEM INTO CAREERS WHERE THEY CAN SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THEY TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF ISSUES YOU ARE REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT BEFORE THE DEBATE. WHAT WAS MISSED? DID ENOUGH ATTENTION GET PAID TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT? &gt;&gt; REALLY QUICKLY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU MIND -- &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; GOING BACK TO THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT ELIZABETH WARREN. THAT'S ACTUALLY FUNNY THAT SHE MADE THAT POINT. I WAS GOING TO SAY WITH ELIZABETH WARREN SHE WAS KIND OF THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT REALLY FOCUSED ON RETRAINING THOSE THAT ARE IN THESE COMMUNITIES WHERE THESE INDUSTRIES ARE DYING, ESPECIALLY WITH THE COAL INDUSTRY AND HOW THAT CONFLICTS WITH TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT, HOW WE OFTEN HAVE TO BALANCE THE TWO, FINDING JOBS OR TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND SEEING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. SO ELIZABETH KIND OF TALKED ABOUT ON THE GREEN DEAL, GREEN NEW DEAL, HELPING THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN THE DYING INDUSTRIES, HELPING THEM TO RETRAIN INTO NEWER INDUSTRIES, THAT WAY THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY LEAVING THEIR JOBS. THEY ARE SIMPLY LEAVING IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HELP NOT ONLY THE ECONOMY, BUT TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT. I THINK THAT WAS INTERESTING. A WHAT WASN'T COVERED ENOUGH AND WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE MORE TOMORROW NIGHT? &gt;&gt; I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY POLICIES. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE TONIGHT, IT WOULD BE INTERESTED INTERESTING TO HEAR HOW IT WILL HELP WORKING WOMEN, COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT ARE TRYING TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. IT COULD BENEFIT IMMIGRANT GROUPS. AND I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF THESE POLICIES AND HOW WHEN WE HAVE UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE, IT WILL BOLSTER OUR SYSTEM AND TRAIN CHILDREN AND GIVEN ATTENTION FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD. &gt;&gt; WHAT WERE SOME EYE ROLL MOMENTS? I DEFINITELY SAW SOME FROM YOU GUYS. ARIANA, I SAW A LOT FROM YOU WHEN CORY BOOKER WAS TALKING. &gt;&gt; A COUPLE LIKE, GOD, YOU GUYS, WHAT WERE SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU WEREN'T SO THRILLED ABOUT? &gt;&gt; WHEN BETO SPOKE SPANISH. SERIOUSLY, I WON'T SAY I DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT I THINK IT CAUGHT PEOPLE OFF GUARD. YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES WERE SHAKEN UP BY THAT. &gt;&gt; IT WAS TRENDING ALL OVER TWITTER. &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT FOR THE FIRST TIME. BUT AS IT CONTINUED ON WITH THE MULTIPLE CANDIDATES, I FELT LIKE ESPECIALLY WITH BOOKER IT FELT LIKE PANDERING FOR SOME REASON, IT WASN'T GENUINE COMING FROM HIM. ANY MOMENT IT DIDN'T FEEL AS GENUINE COMING FROM THE CANDIDATES WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT HIS NEIGHBORHOOD REPEATEDLY IN THE SAME FASHION. I FELT LIKE THAT WAS AN EYE ROLL MOMENT FOR ME. &gt;&gt; QUICK LIGHTNING ROUND, WHO WON TONIGHT IN YOUR EYES? WE'LL START WITH VALENTINA. &gt;&gt; JULIAN CASTRO FOR TALKING POLICY. &gt;&gt; JULIAN CASTRO. &gt;&gt; CASTRO FOR THE SAME REASONS. &gt;&gt; SECRETARY CASTRO. &gt;&gt; I THINK WARREN ACTUALLY DID A GOOD JOB, BUT I DO AGREE, I THOUGHT CASTRO STOOD OUT AS ONE OF THE LESSER-KNOWN CANDIDATES. &gt;&gt; I WAS SURPRISED BY MAYOR De BLASIO'S IDEAS AND HIS MESSAGING. &gt;&gt; WOW, SO CASTRO KIND OF STOLE THE SPOTLIGHT AND De BLASIO CAME OUT. AWESOME. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR STICKING WITH ME AND WATCHING THIS THING WITH US. BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; VALENTINA, CHRIS, ARIANA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL ON THE DEBATE STAGE IN 2024. YOU GUYS TAKE CARE. THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. THANKS. &gt;&gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. &gt;&gt;&gt; THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. I'M MORGAN RADFORD AND WELCOME BACK TO SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL  SHAL DEBATE. WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT HEALTH CARE DEBATE, THEY EXCHANGED ZINGERS. COVERAGE FOR ALL. THEY DISCUSSED THEIR INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE PLANS. HERE ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS. &gt;&gt; WHO HERE WOULD ABOLISH THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IN FAVOR OF A GOVERNMENT-RUN PLAN? JUST A SHOW OF HANDS? [ APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT WENT ON TV ON FOX AND SAID PEOPLE'S HEADS WOULD SPIN WHEN THEY SEE HOW MUCH IT WOULD BRING DOWN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES. INSTEAD, 2,500 DRUGS HAVE GONE UP IN DOUBLE DIGITS SINCE HE CAME INTO OFFICE. FOR THE REST OF US, FOR THE REST OF AMERICA, THAT'S WHAT WE CALL AT HOME ALL FOAM AND NO BEER. WE GOT NOTHING OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; THERE WERE POLITICIANS WHO SAY IT'S JUST NOT POLL R POSSIBLE, WE CAN'T DO IT, HAVE A LOT OF POLITICAL REASONS FOR THIS. WHAT THEY'RE REALLY TELLING YOU IS THEY JUST WON'T FIGHT FOR IT. &gt;&gt; EVERY WOMAN CAN MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. AND AS ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT MAKES THAT POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU REPLACE PRIVATE INSURANCE? &gt;&gt; NO, I THINK THE CHOICE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR ABILITY TO GET EVERYBODY -- &gt;&gt; PRIVATE INSURANCE IS NOT WORKING FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE COPAYS, THE DEDUCTIBLES, THE PREMIUMS, THE OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES, IT'S NOT WORKING. &gt;&gt; INSURANCE COMPANIES LAST YEAR ALONE SUCKED $23 BILLION OUT OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, $23 BILLION. WE HAVE A GIANT INDUSTRY THAT WANTS OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO STAY THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING FOR FAMILIES, BUT IT SURE AS HECK IS WORKING FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; MAKING SURE EVERY SICK AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY IS ABLE TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. I BELIEVE MEDICARE FOR ALL IS THE WAY TO DO THAT. &gt;&gt; I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE HERE WHO HAS PASSED THE LAW PROTECTING A WOMAN'S RIGHT OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN HEALTH INSURANCE. &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THERE ARE THREE WOMEN UP HERE WHO FOUGHT HARD FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS. &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE A WOMAN OR LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET SOMEONE IN THE TRANS COMMUNITY, A TRANS FEMALE IS POOR, DOESN'T MEAN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE THAT RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AND SO I ABSOLUTELY WOULD COVER THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. &gt;&gt; SO, MICHAEL, SALINA, WE WERE TALKING, JACKIE, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE MOMENT DON DELANEY HAD. I THOUGHT IT WAS PARTICULARLY POWERFUL WHEN HE SAID KEEP WHAT'S WORKING, FIX WHAT'S BROKEN. WHAT WAS THE BEST POLICY YOU HEARD FOR HEALTH CARE TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; I CAN'T WEIGH IN ON WHAT I THINK IS THE BEST, BUT I THINK CANDIDATES TO THIS POINT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH HAVING FUZZY OPINIONS WITH WHERE THEY STABBED ON MEDICARE FOR ALL. BERNIE SANDERS INJECTED INTO THE CONVERSATION IN 2016 AND QUICKLY POPULARIZED THAT IN OUR CURRENT ELECTION. AND WHAT YOU SAW THERE WAS WHEN BILL De BLASIO AND ELIZABETH WARREN RAISED THEIR HANDS AS THE ONLY TWO CANDIDATES IN FAVOR OF OUTRIGHT BANNING PRIVATE INSURANCE, THAT WAS PASSING WHAT WE CALL A PURITY TEST AND DRAWING THE MOST EXTREME CONTRAST THAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR. AND THEN YOU HAVE CANDIDATES SORT OF FILLING THE SHADES IN BETWEEN. IT WAS A SUPER INTERESTING CONVERSATION THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SHOULD BE HAVING NOW. DELANEY IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH ESPECIALLY SOMEONE LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN'S OPERATING PRINCIPLES AS A WHOLE, WHICH HAS DRIVEN MOST OF HER POLICY FOR PRESCRIPTIONS. DELANEY IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WHY HE THOUGHT THAT WAS A BAD IDEA. THE JOB OF DEMOCRATS ISN'T NECESSARILY TO SCRAP EVERYTHING IN FAVOR OF THESE, BUT INSTEAD KEEP THINGS THAT ARE WORKING AND SUPPLEMENT THEM WITH MEDICARE FOR ALL, SORT OF A JOINT PRESCRIPTION. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE QUESTION ABOUT ELIMINATING PRIVATE INSURANCE WAS KIND OF INDICATIVE OF THAT LITMUS TEST. WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU SAW WARREN AND De BLASIO -- &gt;&gt; IT'S ALMOST LIKE A TRICK QUESTION BECAUSE WHAT SORT OF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IN A DEMOCRATIC DEBATE IS DO WHAT De BLASIO AND WARREN DID, STAKEOUT YOUR PRINCIPLES AND WHERE YOU STAND ON YOUR VALUES. AND MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IS FOR PROFIT, AND THAT IS NOT LEADING TO THE BEST OUTCOMES IN HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT CARE. AND ANYBODY WHO HAS ACTUALLY TRIED TO USE THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE, IF THEY HAVE A SICK PARENT OR SICK CHILD, WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LONGER TERM SITUATIONS OR VERY COSTLY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, THIS BECOMES AN ISSUE THAT YOU CARE ABOUT. SO PERHAPS YOU LIKE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE YOU NEVER HAD TO USE IT FOR ANYTHING. AND I THINK THAT THE MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING BANKRUPT BECAUSE THEY HAD A MEDICAL CONDITION THAT WAS UNEXPECTED OR A SICK CHILD, THE MORE THE ARGUMENT THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD DO AWAY WITH THE SYSTEM THAT IS BANKRUPTING FAMILIES, I THINK THAT CAN RESONATE WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT THE REAL WORLD CIRCUMSTANCES. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION BECAUSE WHEN WE TOOK IT TO TWITTER AND WE ASKED IS THERE ANY TOPIC YOU DIDN'T SEE TONIGHT, TIM FROM TWITTER SAID -- EXCUSE ME, ANDRE DAVIS SAID MENTAL HEALTH. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WASN'T ADDRESSED? &gt;&gt; WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT, ONE OF THE CANDIDATES ACTUALLY DID SORT OF BRING IT UP ON THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE. RIGHT. IT DID COME UP A LITTLE BIT. RIGHT, RIGHT. I'M NOT SURE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES, AS THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING TO GIVE ME THE BEST HEADLINE TOMORROW AFTER THE DEBATE, I'M NOT NECESSARILY SURE THAT THAT'S THE MOST JUICIEST, HAVING WORKED ON PREVIOUSMENT CAMPAIGNS, YOU HAVE TO, ONE, BRING IN NEW DONORS, AND TWO, BRING IN NEW POTENTIAL VOTERS UNDER YOUR TENT THAT CAN HELP YOU GROW AND BUILD THE TYPE OF COALITION YOU NEED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER MOMENT WE SAW THAT REALLY GOT REACTION WAS THE QUESTION OF ABORTION AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS. DO YOU THINK ANYONE STOOD OUT PARTICULARLY ON THAT ISSUE? &gt;&gt; JULIAN CASTRO. &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? &gt;&gt; HIS ANSWER WAS PERFECT TO ME. HE EVEN BROUGHT UP TRANS RIGHTS. &gt;&gt; NOT REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. I AM A PROFESSIONAL FEMINIST. I'VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL FEMINIST FOR A DECADE. THE FACT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SAID REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND NOT RIGHTS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT. THE REASON WHY IS RIGHTS IS BASICALLY ONLY ABOUT ABORTION. IT'S USUALLY ONLY ABOUT PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF, YOU KNOW, MORE AFFLUENT WHITE WOMEN. AND IT OBSCURES THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ACCESS TO ABORTION. IT'S ABOUT ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL. IT'S ABOUT ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL TO TREAT UTERINE FIBROIDS OR OTHER ISSUE THAT IS NOT PREGNANCY RELATED. IT IS ALSO RELATED TO MAKING SURE YOU CAN RAISE YOUR FAMILY IN A SAFE COMMUNITY, THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THROUGHOUT THAT CHILD'S LIFE AND YOUR OWN LIFE, AND THAT THEY CAN RISE UP THE SOCIOECONOMIC LADDER. IT IS A MORE POLARISTIC APPROACH. TO SERI PRODUCTIVE JUSTICE -- YES. HILLARY CLINTON DID TALK ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD. BUT I CAN'T RECALL HER SAYING THOSE WORDS, AND THAT'S A BIG MOMENT. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU THINK, JACKIE? DID YOU FEEL LIKE THE ISSUE, THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND THE ISSUE AROUND ABORTION WAS ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED BY THE CANDIDATES? &gt;&gt; I DO, AND I REALLY DID APPRECIATE AMY KLOBUCHAR AND GOVERNOR INSLEE. &gt;&gt; YES. WAS THERE SLINGING GOING ON? &gt;&gt; PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT, A BOLD CLAIM, HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO PROTECT ABORTION RIGHTS. MEANWHILE, THERE ARE CANDIDATES ON THE STAGE WHO ALSO -- &gt;&gt; LEGISLATION. &gt;&gt; YEAH. BUT WHAT I'M ACTUALLY CURIOUS TO SEE JOE BIDEN ANSWER THAT QUESTION TOMORROW. I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED BIDEN'S NAME DIDN'T COME UP DURING THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN BEHIND THE CURVE ESPECIALLY IN THE CONVERSATION OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE BECAUSE HE HASN'T SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF THE ISSUES AROUND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS WOMEN OF COLOR. &gt;&gt; THE HYDE AMENDMENT. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY. THERE WAS REPORTING THAT HIS TOP ADVISORS HAD TO EDUCATE HIM ON WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO CHANGE HIS MIND AND FLIP-FLOP ON THE HYDE AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW HE'S GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WHEN HE'S PUT ON THE SPOT TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GET YOUR OPINION, THOUGH, ON THE CONCEPT OF FLIP-FLOPPING THAT JACKIE BROUGHT UP. THERE WAS A VERY POINTED MOMENT IN TULSI GABBARD AS WELL. THEY SAID HOLD ON. WE LOOK AT YOUR RECORD WHEN IT CAME TO GAY RIGHTS. SHE WAS ALSO SOMEONE WHO CHANGED HER POSITION ON ABORTION. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK AT THIS STAGE IN THE PROCESS IT DOES WHEN A CANDIDATE HAS SWITCHED THEIR POSITION? &gt;&gt; I MEAN, LOOK, EVERY CANDIDATE AT SOME POINT IS GOING TO HAVE TO RESPOND TO PREVIOUS STATEMENTS, TO PREVIOUS VOTING RECORDS IF THEY HAVE SERVED IN CONGRESS, HOUSE OR SENATE. AND I'M NOT SURPRISED CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE, THE DATA, THE ANALYTICS AND SAY, WAIT A MINUTE, I'M NOT IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE THAT I NEED TO HELP ME WIN THIS THING. SO PERHAPS I NEED TO PIVOT, WHICH IS WHY WE SAW JOE BIDEN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A PIVOT, ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL. I WOULD CAUTION DEMOCRATS, THERE ARE, I WOULD SAY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF AMERICANS WHO WILL SAY I'M OPEN TO SOME OF THESE OTHER IDEAS, BUT I'M NOT ALL THE WAY THERE YET. AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND ONCE YOU GET OUT OF THIS PRIMARY PROCESS, IT'S GENERAL ELECTION. THE DYNAMICS CHANGE. I'VE DONE IT THREE TIMES. YOU'RE TALKING TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY NOW, NOT JUST THE LOUDEST VOICES IN YOUR PARTY. IF YOU ISOLATE TOO MANY PEOPLE, YOU RISK ALREADY JEOPARDIZING YOUR ODDS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SAYING VOTERS SHOULD BE MORE PATIENT? &gt;&gt; I'M SAYING THAT CANDIDATES NEED TO BE MORE SMARTER IN HOW THEY NAVIGATE THIS PROCESS. &gt;&gt; BUT IS IT ENOUGH TO SAY, I HAVE EVOLVED? IS THAT A SATISFACTORY ANSWER FOR A VOTER? &gt;&gt; I THINK YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN WHY AND HOW. AND I THINK THAT WHAT JOE BIDEN DID NOT DO YET, TOMORROW TO YOUR POINT IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY, IS TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY HIS TRANSITION FROM THE WRONG POSITION ON HYDE TO THE CORRECTION POSITION OR AT LEAST THE PARTY'S POSITION ON HYDE. &gt;&gt; WALK THE VOTERS THROUGH THEIR THOUGHTS THROUGH THAT? &gt;&gt; HE NEEDS TO WALK VOTERS THROUGH THAT PROCESS. HE CAN'T BE DEFENSIVE AND SAY THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE, OR THIS IS MY PERSONAL BELIEF BECAUSE I'M A CATHOLIC AND THIS IS MY FAITH OR MY PERSONAL BELIEF ABOUT ABORTION AS AN ISSUE, AS OPPOSED TO A POLICY ISSUE THAT IMPACTS WOMEN, RIGHT? BECAUSE I THINK THE DEBATE THAT WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW ABOUT HYDE AND ABOUT ALL OF THESE ISSUES RELATED TO WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T PERSONALLY BELIEVE IN ABORTION WANT TO SAY THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU PERSONALLY BELIEVE ABOUT ABORTION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POLICIES THAT IMPACT EVERYONE. SO YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PERSONAL BELIEVES AND YOUR PERSONAL FAITH, BUT THE POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS THAT IMPACT ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS SHOULD UPHOLD THE RIGHTS TO THE SUPREME COURT AND THAT ARE IN THE CONSTITUTION. THAT ESSENTIALLY IS THE DEBATE RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABORTION SPECIFICALLY, BUT I THINK IT ACTUALLY TOUCHES ON OTHER ISSUES, TOO. &gt;&gt; WHICH IS INTERESTING. WHERE DO THE ROLE OF PERSONAL BELIEVES COME IN AND PERSONAL CONNECTION? WE WERE TALKING A LOT DURING THE BREAK. WHEN WE HEARD THOSE COLLEGE STUDENTS, NO, WE DIDN'T LIKE WHEN WE HEARD BETO SPEAK SPANISH. NO ONE SAID -- &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION. I THINK IT'S THE WAY YOU DO IT. IT'S MORE THE METHOD THAN THE FACT YOU'RE DOING IT. IF HE HAD STARTED SORT OF WITH A MORE NATURAL SEGUE INTO THE SPANISH, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE COME ACROSS MORE AUTHENTIC. IT SEEMED TO BE -- HE JUMPED RIGHT INTO IT. OH, LET ME SHOW YOU THIS TRICK I CAN DO, EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; A TRICK. &gt;&gt; YES, I THINK IT WAS A METHOD FOR HIM TO SHOW OFF AS OPPOSED TO CONNECT. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU THINK, JACKIE, DO YOU THINK IT WAS A CONNECTIVE MECHANISM? &gt;&gt; I DEFINITELY THINK IT WAS A PROP HE THOUGHT OF AHEAD OF TIME. I SAW ARTICLES ON STRATEGIZING AND BRAINSTORMING CAMPAIGNS TO GET CANDIDATES VIRAL MOMENTS AND HOW THEY WERE GOING TO PUSH THAT OUT AND MAKE IT GO EVEN MORE VIRAL. BUT THOSE KIDS WHO THEY SPOKE WITH IS MORE IN TUNE -- I THINK HAVE A PULSE ON THE AUTHENTICITY TEST THAN THE UNDER 30 AGE RANGE. IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY SAW, THEY SAW SOME PEOPLE PANDERING TO THE COMMUNITY, AND OTHERS LIKE JULIAN CASTRO BEING AUTHENTIC AND GENUINE. I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF EVEN JOE BIDEN ADDRESSING A FLIP-FLOP OR SOMEONE APOLOGIZING OR EXPLAINING THEIR EVOLUTION. AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHY OBAMA WAS SO SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE PEOPLE FELT THAT AUTHENTICITY. &gt;&gt; I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A PERSONAL BELIEF AS A CANDIDATE AND STILL RECOGNIZE AS A PRESIDENT, I'M SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT AND LEAD THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. THEREFORE, I RECOGNIZE IF I'M NOT IN SYNC WITH WHERE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS GOING, I STILL HAVE TO LEAD WITH WHAT YOU GUYS EXPECT. I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA, TO YOUR POINT, WAS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AT DOING THAT. THESE ARE MY PERSONAL BELIEFS, BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY -- AND I NEED TO TRY TO MEET THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY ARE. I THINK JOE BIDEN NEEDS TO SORT OF ARTICULATE THAT TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU DO THAT STYLISTICALLY SO YOU STILL CONVEY AUTHENTICITY? &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK IT'S BIBLICAL FOR JOE BIDEN TO SAY, LOOK, I'M A CATHOLIC. MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS. I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M ON THE SIDE OF WOMEN, SIMPLE. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A FINE LINE THERE BECAUSE WHEN YOU APOLOGIZE ONCE, JOE BIDEN COULD BE A POLL JAY ZING FOR EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; I DO THINK THAT'S THE TRICK WHEN YOU HAVE A LONG RECORD. WHEN YOU HAVE THIS DECADES LONG RECORD, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT TO EXPLAIN. THE CRIME BILL IS ANOTHER THING THAT'S GOING TO COME UP. IT CAME UP FOR HILLARY CLINTON EVEN THOUGH SHE WASN'T IN OFFICE, BUT JOE BIDEN WROTE THAT CRIME BILL. THERE ARE A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE IN PRISON AS A LULT. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK TO THAT CONSTITUENCY AND EXPLAIN, I DIDN'T SEE THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. I DIDN'T FORESEE IT. &gt;&gt; THE EVOLUTION. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT MORE EXPLAINING TO DO, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO BIDEN TOMORROW. LET'S SAVE THAT FOR TOMORROW. RIGHT NOW &gt;&gt;&gt; SIR MICHAEL ALEX AND ANGELINA ARE BACK WITH US NOW. TOMORROW THERE ARE SOME BIG NAMES ON THE DEBATE STAGE. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING TO HEAR TOMORROW? &gt;&gt; LOOK, JOE BIDEN, IN MY OPINION, HAS THE MOST TO LOSE. AND I GUARANTEE YOU THAT BERNIE SANDERS IS GOING TO COME VERY HARD FOR JOE BIDEN. BUT I THINK PEOPLE FORGET JOE BIDEN IS A VERY TALENTED DEBATER HIMSELF. I THINK BIDEN HAS TO PUT HIMSELF AS I AM THE BEST PERSON TO GO HEAD TO HEAD WITH TRUMP. WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES, IF I WAS ADVISING THEM, I WOULD SAY BRING UP YOUR YEARS WITH OBAMA. I DID THIS, I WAS WORKING ON ISSUES YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE. I WAS THERE. IF YOU ELECT ME, I'LL MAKE THEM COME TO FRUITION. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT FIREWORKS, ALEX, DO YOU EXPECT THERE TO BE MORE ZINGER TOMORROW NIGHT? &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE FRONT RUNNER ON THE STAGE AND THREE OF THE OTHER TOP FIVE CANDIDATES THAT ARE RIGHT BEHIND HIM AND THEY ALL WANT TO TAKE HIM. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL IS MAYOR PETE AND BIDEN HAVE BOTH HAD ROCKY FEW WEEKS. PETE IS DEFINITELY GOING TO GET A SENSE ABOUT THE COP WHO SHOT A BLACK MAN AND HIS RESPONSE TO IT. BIDEN IS GOING TO BE TAKING IT FROM ALL SIDES. EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE WATCHING. DOES HE HAVE A SENIOR MOMENT? DOES HE LOSE IT? DOES HE GET DEFENSIVE? BECAUSE EVERYONE IS EVALUATING HOW WILL HE LOOK AGAINST ON THE STAGE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. IN IN MAKING AN ELECTABILITY ARGUMENT, YOU CAN'T FALTER. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN HERE, YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS PROCESS BEFORE. HOW DOES HAVING THE FRONT RUNNER, DEBATING THE FRONT RUNNER, HOW DOES THAT CHANGE YOUR STRATEGY? &gt;&gt; I THINK OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS MANY PEOPLE RUNNING, SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE ALL AT THE SAME TIME AS OPPOSED TO JUST BERNIE SANDERS TRYING TO TAKE DOWN HILLARY CLINTON WHO WAS THE FRONT RUNNER IN 2016. THE STRATEGY IS STICK TO YOUR POINTS. DON'T TRY TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S NEW. &gt;&gt; DO YOU LOSE PASSION WHEN YOU DO THAT? &gt;&gt; PERHAPS. BUT THE CHALLENGE OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IS COMBINE THE POLICY AND PASSION TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY ELIZABETH WARREN HAS BEEN RISING. SHE'S ALWAYS HAD THE PASSION. ADDING THE POLICY RELEASES THAT. TOMORROW IT'S HOW DOES JOE BIDEN RESPOND TO THE ATTACKS THAT ARE GOING TO COME TO HIS WAY INEVITABLY. AND WHETHER OR NOT HE'S GOING TO BE DISMISSIVE OF SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES AND WOMEN ON THE STAGE. I'M LOOKING FOR AN AWKWARD JOE BIDEN GAFF. &gt;&gt; OKAY. YOU SAY AWKWARD. ALEX, YOU SAID SENIOR MOMENT. IS AGE GOING TO BE A FACTOR TOMORROW NIGHT? &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE PETE BUTTIEGIEG WHO IS 37 RIGHT NEAR JOE BIDEN WHO IS 76. BERNIE SANDERS IS 77. HE IS HALF THEIR AGE. IF NOT, THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO DO LITTLE THINGS BIG AND SMALL TO TRY TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE YOUNGER, MORE VIBRANT. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, BERNIE IS GOING TO WATCH HOW CRANKY HE GETS. BIDEN, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE DOES HE MEANDER, DOES HE GET OFF POINT, DOES HE NOT QUITE MAKE THE SENTENCES CONNECT. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL? &gt;&gt; THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT AGE AND WISDOM THAT I THINK WE ALL VALUE, AND I WILL REMIND YOU GUYS OF RONALD REAGAN. IF YOU RECALL, HE HAD THAT ONE LINER ABOUT I WILL NOT, MY OPPONENT AND HIS YOUTHFULNESS. JOE BIDEN NEEDS TO HAVE THAT KIND OF MOMENT IF SOMEONE DOES ATTEMPT TO ATTACK HIM BECAUSE OF THE HIS AGE BEING 76, I BELIEVE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT MOST VOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT, IT'S NOT AGE. IT'S WHO CAN DEFEAT TRUMP. IT'S NOT AGE, NOT GENDER. DEMOCRATIC VOTERS, WHO CAN GO TOE TO TOE WITH DONALD TRUMP. RIGHT NOW MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT INDIVIDUAL IS JOE BIDEN. THAT'S A HUGE ADVANTAGE GOING INTO TOMORROW NIGHT. &gt;&gt; I THINK HE'S THE DEFAULT CHOICE. HE'S A PLACE HOLDER. I THINK HE'S THE PLACE HOLDER FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE TRUMP. THEY WANT TO WIN. AND HE IS A KNOWN QUANTITY. THERE ARE SO MANY CANDIDATES THAT YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE, SO YOU'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THEM. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW LIKE JULIAN CASTRO AND FOLLOW HIM MORE CLOSELY AND THAT MAYBE PULLS AWAY FROM BIDEN A BIT. &gt;&gt; WE SAW THE GLOVES COME OFF TONIGHT. WILL THEY COME OFF TOMORROW? THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STICKING AROUND ALL NIGHT, ALL FOUR HOURS OF THIS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN TOMORROW.
