753281	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	So I think of it this way, who is this economy really working for? It's doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. It's doing great for giant drug companies. This is not doing great for people are trying to get a prescription filled. It's doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons just not for the African-Americans and Latinx whose families are torn apart whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753282	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	It's doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us. When you've got a government--when you've got an economy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great for everyone else that is corruption, pure and simple.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753283	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	We need to call it out. We need to attack it had on and we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753284	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	Well, first, the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what is going on when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums. So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids; I do.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753285	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	But I think my plan is a good one and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education. My own dad and my sister got their first agrees with community college. There's many paths to success as well as certifications.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753286	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	Secondly I would use programs. I would double them from $6000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered up to families that make up to $100,000. And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans because I can tell you this, if billionaires--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753288	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	This economy has got to work for everyone and right now we know that it isn't and it's going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does. (UNTRANSLATED)	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753289	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	Right now we have a system that favors those that can pay for access and outcomes, that is how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest. A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753290	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	A new democracy that is revised because we have returned power to the people, no pacts, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753291	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	That's how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753292	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	I would support a--a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital at the same rate--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753293	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	--that you--you tax ordinary income. Take the corporate tax rate up to 28 percent. You would generate the revenues--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753295	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	I don't think I disagree. I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation. You see the evidence of that in how dignity is being strip from labor and we a people who work full-time jobs and still can't make a living wage.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753296	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs and use see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that is hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753297	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector. So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753298	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	And I will tell you this I live in a low-income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used from GDP to Wall Street's rankings is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753299	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	Well, again I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. And when it comes to antitrust law what I would do is number one appoint judges that will enforce it; number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753300	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	At the end of the day we have too much of a problem with corporate-	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753301	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	--on the Affordable Care Act, and that is a public option. I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in a four years, which is exactly what this bill says.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753302	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	So, let me go on beyond that. There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals. The president literally went on TV on Fox and said that people's heads would spend when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office. Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies. For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that's what we call at home all foam and no beer. We got nothing out of it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753303	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	And so, my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries. And pharma thinks they own Washington. Well, they don't own me.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753304	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	So, yes, I'm with Bernie on Medicare for All, and let me tell you why. I've spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is the cost of healthcare, medical bills. And that's not just for people who don't have insurance. It's for people who have insurance.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753305	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	Look at the business model of an insurance company. It's to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your healthcare. That leaves families with rising premiums, rising co-pays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the healthcare that their doctors say that they and their children need. Medicare for All solves that problem.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753306	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	And I understand there are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible. We just can't do it. It's--have a lot of political reasons for this. What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Well, healthcare is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753307	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	That means Medicare for All.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753308	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have healthcare. In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man, 27 years old, told me that he'd been to a doctor once in his life. And on that visit, he was told he had diabetes, was told he had glaucoma, and he was told untreated, because he doesn't have healthcare, he'll be dead before the age of 40.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753309	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	So, getting to guaranteed, high quality, universal healthcare as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal; the ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, the--the ability to see a mental health care provider. In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753310	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	And healthcare also has to mean that every woman can make our own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753311	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	Our plan says that if you're uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare. If you're insufficiently in short, you can afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare. But if you're a member of a union that negotiated for a healthcare plan that you like because it works for you--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753329	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-06-26	Why are you defending private insurance to begin with?	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753330	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	--Yes--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753331	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	I think we're talking about this in the wrong way. You're talking about one bill over another bill. Really, what we're talking about is our objective, making sure that every single American in this country is able to get the health care that they need. I believe Medicare for All is the way to do that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753332	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	I also think that employers recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare for All program, a program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality healthcare that they need.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753333	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	--I also think if you--if you look at other countries in the world who have universal healthcare, every one of them has some form of a role of--of private insurance. I think that's what we've got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need regardless--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753334	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	--Of how much or little money they have in their pocket.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753335	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	I absolutely will. First of all, we're talking about this as a healthcare issue. But in communities like mine, low income communities, it's an education issue because kids who don't have healthcare are not going to succeed in school. It is an issue for jobs--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753336	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	--And employment because people that do not have good health care do not succeed at work. It's even a retirement issue because, in my community, African-Americans have a lower life expectancy because of the poorer health care.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753337	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	And so, where I stand is very clear. Healthcare is not just a human right, it should be an American right. And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for All. But I have an urgency about this. When I am president of the United States, I'm not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753338	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	And on this debate, I'm sorry. There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America from the--from pharmaceutical companies to insurers. Literally, the overhead for insurers that they charge is 15 percent, while Medicare's overhead is only at 2 percent. We can do this better, and every single day I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable cost until we get to my goal--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753343	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	--Point though. And that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the healthcare system, $23 billion, and that doesn't count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington. We have a giant industry that wants our healthcare system to stay the way it is, because it's not working for families but it's sure as heck working for them.

753347	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	I just want to say there's three women appear that have fought pretty hard for a woman's right to choose, so I'll start with that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753348	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal healthcare. And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved. You could do it either way. At its--the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered. So, I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you moved to universal healthcare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753349	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-06-26	Yes, it would. I don't believe only in reproductive freedom. I believe in reproductive justice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

So, I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion. More than that everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today a person's right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri and Alabama, in Georgia. I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v Wade and will respect.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753352	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-06-26	And in addition to that make sure that we fight hard as we transition our healthcare system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753353	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive healthcare services and that includes birth control, it includes abortion, it includes everything for a woman.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753354	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	And, I want to add on that--it's not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us. 47 years ago Roe versus Wade was decided and we've all looked to the courts all that time. As state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions has come right up to the age of taking away protection.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753357	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	--I will not take contributions from corporate tax or pharma executives because they are part of this problem. And this opioid addiction in our country we in cities like mine have been seeing how we have been trying to arrest our way out of addiction for too long. It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical that are responsible help to--help to pay for that.

It's the largest prison population on the face of the planet. Many are there for non-violent drug crimes including possession of marijuana at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized. And despite what Purdue Pharma has done--their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we're seeing throughout this country they've been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences not a single night in jail. Unless there's accountability and justice this crisis will continue. In my administration we will hold them to account. We will make sure that they pay a price and we will help those that have been a victim of these malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long-term care.

If I were president I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump's zero tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy and the metering policy. This metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river--river. They have been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at the ports of entry. Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim. So, they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river and they died because of that.

What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here and that is that seventy of our Fortune five hundred companies are headed up by people that came from other countries, twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel Laureates were born in other countries. We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories, we need them to start small businesses. We need their ideas and this president has literally gone backwards at a time where our economy needs immigrants.

753404	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	Well, this is a related and brief point because what we are talking about--what Secretary Castro and I are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process. I have been to some of the largest private persons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and they are immigration lockups. Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things whether it's immigration, whether it's mental illness, whether it's addiction. We know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solve this problem.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753405	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	Donald Trump is in solving this problem. We've seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place and we make sure we use our resources to provide healthcare, to affirm the values of human dignity that people that come here because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753406	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal. And one of the reasons why we are seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of the deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and push back a nuclear breakout 10--20 years. And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled--being pulled in further and further into this crisis.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

But my point is, and it's important for us to recognize this, is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton and others are creating a situation that just a spark would light up a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous.

Someone I knew Shahad Smith(PH) was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year. For millions of Americans this is not a policy issue this is an urgency.

I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe High School shooting. A young student named Bree (PH), her friend Marcell (PH), who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Heart (PH). They talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole. We know that they save lives. Talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.

If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity then we will have set a new standard and that is that some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law and we cannot allow that to stand.

That's why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college. That's why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out, they're making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen.

People don't like their private insurance companies, they like their doctors and hospitals. Under our plan people go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want.

538323	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-06-27	The reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard and I will para--paraphrase there is in the unite--America a parent who is seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control, calls 911 what should I do and they say take the child to the emergency room and so they get in their car and they drive and there sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors while they have the hand on the four head of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors even though they have insurance they will be out 5000 deductible--$5000 deductible when they walk through those doors.

538325	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	Because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And remember, we're talking about something people are getting a--given a chance to buy into. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538326	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	But of course, the real problem is we shouldn't have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship.

538327	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	-- The American people agree on what to do. This is the crazy thing. If leadership consists of--of forming a consensus around a divisive issue, this White House has divided us around a consensus issue. The American people want a pathway to citizenship. They wanted protections for Dreamers. We need to clean up the lawful immigration system, like how my father immigrated to this country. And as part of a compromise, we can do whatever commonsense measures are needed at the border.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News

You cannot let--as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can't do that.

538335	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	But here's the deal. The deal is that he's right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also--for example, they've increased the lifespan of Social Security because they're--they have a job. They're paying the Social Security tax. That's what they're doing. It's increase the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until there in extremis.

538336	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	The other thing is, folks, look, we can deal with these insurance companies.

538342	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-06-27	And I will ensure that the--this microphone that the President of the United States holds in her hand is use din a way that is about reflecting the values of our country and not about locking children up, separating them from their parents. And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people. A mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico facing unknown peril to come here why would that mother do that? I will tell you. Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse. But what does Donald Trump do? He says go back to where you came from. That is not reflective of our America and our values and it has got to end.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538343	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	John Hickenlooper	2019-06-27	Certainly the images we've seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by. If you had ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents, put them in cages, actually put them up for adoption--in Colorado we call that kidnapping. I--I would have called you--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538344	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	John Hickenlooper	2019-06-27	I would have told you it was unbelievable. And the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is and make sure there are the sufficient facil-facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families. The children are with their families. We have to make sure that--that ICE is completely reformed. And they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way where they are addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border. And we have to make sure, ultimately, that we provide not just shelter, but food, clothing and access to medical care.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538345	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	Let's remember that's not just a theoretical exercise, that criminalization that is the basis for family separation. You do away with that it is no longer possible. Of course it wouldn't be possible anyway in my presidency because it is dead wrong. We have got to talk about one other thing because the Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion. Now our party doesn't talk about that as much largely for a very good reason which was we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion. But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it in for a party that associates itself with Christianity to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.

538347	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	The first thing I would do is unite families. I would surge immediately billions of dollars' worth of help to the region the immediately. Look, I talk about foreign policy. I am the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign, at the very end of our term to spend $740 million to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working. We saw as you know a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was updated and along came this President and he said he immediately discontinued that. We all talk about these things, I did it. I did it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538348	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	740--now look, second thing--second thing we have to do, the law now requires the reuniting of those families. We would reunite those families period and if not we would put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents. And lastly the idea that he is in court with his Justice Department saying children in cages do not need a bed, do not need a blanket, do not need a toothbrush--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538349	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	That is outrageous.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News

538351	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	--close to immoral. But the fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up. We should be making sure we change the circumstance, as we did, why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538352	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-06-27	That person should not be the focus of deportation. We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News

538357	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-06-27	Well, thank you. I will say, no, absolutely not. They should not be deported. And I actually--this was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration, with whom I otherwise had a great relationship and a great deal of respect. But on the secure communities issue, I was Attorney General of California. I led the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, in a state of 40 million people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News
538358	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-06-27	And on this issue, I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who, by ICE's own definition, were non-criminals. So, as Attorney General and the chief law officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest of public safety of their community. Because what I saw--and I was tracking it every day. I was tracking it and saw that--that parents, people who had not committed a crime even by ICE's own definition, were being deported.

I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that's now disappeared and gone forever. And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or--or people in China. It's been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void.

538371	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	Yeah, I mean first of all, we've got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one. This is not something to dismiss or wave away. And if you look at what China is doing. They're using technology for the perfection of dictatorship. But, their fundamental economic model isn't gonna change because of some tariffs. I live in the industrial Midwest. Folks who aren't in the shadow of a factory or somewhere near a soy field where I live. And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting. Tariffs are taxes. And Americans are gonna pay on average $800 more a year because of these tariffs. Meanwhile, China is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence.

We've got a much bigger issue on our hands.

538375	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Pete Buttigieg	2019-06-27	Because I couldn't get it done. My community is in anguish right now because of an officer involved shooting. A black man Eric Logan killed by a white officer. And I'm not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer says he was attacked with a knife, but he didn't have his body camera on. It's a mess. And we're hurting. And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community--all of the steps that we took from bias training to de-escalation but it didn't save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother's eyes I have to face the fact and nothing that I say will bring him back. This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country. And until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time. Not just from what has happened in the past but what's happening around the country in the present. It threatens the well being of every community. And I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing. A feeling not of fear but of safety. I'm determined to bring that day about.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News

We had a shooting when I first became mayor 10 years before Ferguson and the community came together and we created an office of the independent monitor--civilian oversight commission. We diversified the police force in two years. We actually did de-escalation training.

538386	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-06-27	Okay. So, on the issue of race, I couldn't agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly. I--there is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination. Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn't play with us because she--because we were black. And I will say also that--that in this campaign, we've also heard--and I'm going to now direct this to Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 27 (Full) | NBC News

538388	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-06-27	But, I also believe--and it's personal. And I--I was actually very--it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose bussing. And you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day and that little girl was me. So, I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly.

Democrats and Americans around the country have one question for their nominee and that is who can beat Donald Trump in 2020. That is the right question.

I am that candidate. I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump. It is not left. It is not right. It is forward and that is where I'll take the country in 2020.

737339	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	I think you can buy into it. That's the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. Look, this is a distinction without a difference, whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums. Look, in this country, if you have health coverage--if you don't have health coverage, you're paying too much for care. And if you do have health coverage, you're paying--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737341	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	The answer is no, the middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world class healthcare. I think we're being offered in a false choice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737342	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	Some who want to improve the affordable care act at the margins. Others who want a Medicare for all program that will force people off of private insurance. I have a better path--Medicare for America. Everyone who is uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow. Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled in Medicare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737343	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	Those who have (INAUDIBLE).	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737344	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	You have some, Governor Bullock, who said that we will improve the affordable care act at the margins with a public option. You have others to my right who are talking about taking away people's choice for the private insurance that they have or members of unions. I was listening today--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737345	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	His--his (INAUDIBLE) they are offering a false choice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737346	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	Every--every estimate that I've seen of expanding ACA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the healthcare that they need as the example that Senator Warren showed us. Our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in Medicare or can keep their employer sponsored insurance. When we listen to the American people and this is what they want us to do--they want everyone covered but they want to be able to maintain choice and our plan does that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737347	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	That is incorrect. I just have a better way to do this. And in one of my first debates, Jake, I was called a street fighter from the iron range by my opponent. And when she said it I said, thank you. So, this is what I think we need to get done. We need the public option. That's what Barack Obama wanted and it would bring healthcare costs down for everyone. And by the way, I just don't buy this. I've heard some of these candidates say that it somehow not moral if you -- not moral to not have that public option. Well Senator Sanders was actually on a public option bill last year and that was Bernie the Medicaid public option bill that Senator Schatz introduced. Clearly, this is the easiest way to move forward quickly and I want to get things done. People can't wait. I've got my friend Nicole out there whose son was actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager and he died because he didn't have enough money to pay for it. And Bernie and I have worked on pharmaceutical (INAUDIBLE) together--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737348	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	We can get health expenses (INAUDIBLE).	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737349	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	As the author of the Medicare bill let me clear up one thing--as people talk about having insurance there are millions of people who have insurance they can't go to the doctor and when they come out of the hospital they go bankrupt, all right?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737350	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	What I am talking about and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no copayments. And Jake, your question is a republican talking point. At the end of the day and by the way--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737351	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	And by the way, by the way the healthcare industry will be advertising tonight on this program.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737352	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Oh, can I complete that please?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737353	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	They are advertising tonight with that talking point.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737354	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	We need to think of this in terms of the big frame. What's the problem in Washington? It works great for the wealthy. It works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers. And it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies. What it's going to take is real courage to fight back against them. These insurance companies do not have a god given right to make $23 billion in profits and suck it out of our healthcare system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737355	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	They do not have a god given right--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737358	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Well obviously, I disagree with that, as much as I respect both of the senators to my right. You know, I think it comes down to that question of Americans being used to being able to make choices, to have the right to make a decision. And I think proposing a public option that allows some form of Medicare but maybe as accommodation of--of Medicare Advantage and Medicare, but people choose it and if enough people choose it, it--it expands, the quality improves, the cost comes down, or people choose it. Eventually, in 15 years, you could get there, but it would be an evolution, not a revolution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737359	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	You know--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737360	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--We have tried this experiment with the insurance companies and what they've done is they've sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system and they force people to have to fight to try to get the healthcare coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need. Why does everybody--why does every doctor, why does every hospital have to fill out so many collocated forms? It's because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737361	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	That's what we have to fight.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737362	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	It is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say. Look, if--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737363	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--If--it's true that if we embrace a far-left agenda, they are going to say we are a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what we are--they're going to do? They're going to say we are a bunch of crazy socialist. So let's just stand up for the right policy--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737364	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Go out there and defend it. That's a policy I'm putting forward, not because I think is the right triangulation between Republicans here and to progress there, because I think it's the right answer for people like my mother-in-law who is here whose life was saved by the ACA but who is still far too vulnerable to the fact of the insurance industry--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737365	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--Does not care about her.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737367	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Let's be clear what this debate is about. Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system. What we are taking at--on is the fact that over the last 20 years the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent $4.5 billion dollars of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions. That is why when I went to Canada the other day people paid a 10th the price in Canada for insulin--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737368	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--That they are paying in the United States.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737369	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, two things. They will be better because Medicare for all is comprehensive and covers all health care needs for senior citizens. It will finally include dental care, hearing aids, and eyeglasses.

737373	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	And second of all--second of all, many of our union brothers and sisters, nobody more pro-union than me up here, are now paying high deductibles in copayments. And when we do Medicare for All, instead of having the company putting money on-	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737374	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	healthcare they can get decent wage increases which they are not getting today.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737375	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Under Medicare for all the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they are not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737377	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare but our job is to run a nonprofit health care system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737378	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Furthermore--furthermore, when we save $500 billion a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737380	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Hospitals will be better off than they are today.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737381	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	When I am president illegally crossing the border will still be a legal. We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law but we've got a crisis on our hands and it's not just a crisis of immigration, it's a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border. It is the stain on the United States of America.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737382	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Americans want comprehensive immigration reform and frankly we have been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime. Protections for dreamers, making sure that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, cleaning up lawful immigration. We know what to do. We know the border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737383	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	The problem is we haven't had the will to get it done in Washington and now we have a president who could fix it in a month because there is that bipartisan agreement but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement. That will end on my watch.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737384	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	So in my view if fraud is involved in that is suitable for the criminal statute. If not then it should be handled under civil law but the show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737385	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	We appreciate that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737386	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	I do because in my administration after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders, more than 9 million of our fellow Americans free dreamers many fear of deportation and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge and for-profit detention in this country and assisted those countries in Central America so that no family ever has to make that 2000 mile journey then I expect that people who come here follow our laws and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737387	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	So, the problem is that right now the criminalization statute is what gives Donald Trump the ability to take children away from their parents it's what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders. We need to continue to have border security and we can do that. But what we can't do is not live our values. I've been down to the border. I have seen the mothers. I have seen the pages of babies. We must be a country that everyday lives our values and that means we cannot make it a crime--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737388	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--Yes--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737389	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	The point is not about criminalization that has given Donald Trump the tool to break families apart.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737390	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	We need--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737391	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Well, I agree that we need to secure borders. There's no question about that and the--the frustration with what's going on in Washington is they are kicking the ball back and forth. Secure the borders. Make sure whatever law we have doesn't allow children to be snatched from their parents and put in cages. How hard can that be? We got I don't know on the two debate nights we got 170 years of Washington experience somehow that seems like it should be fairly fixable.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737392	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Well, and one way to fix it is to decriminalize. That's the whole point. What we're looking for here is a way to take away the tools that Donald Trump has--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737393	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--used to break up families.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737394	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	I would say there is the will to change this in congress. What's missing is the right person in the White House. I believe that immigrants don't diminish America. They are America. And if you want to do something about border security you first of all change the rules so that people can seek asylum in those Northern Triangle countries. Then you pass the bill and what the bill will do is it will greatly reduce the deficit and give us the money for border security and for border processing the cases. And most of all, it will allow for a path to citizenship. Because this is not just about the border. Donald Trump wants to use these people as political pawns.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737395	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	We have people all over our country that simply want to work and obey the law.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737396	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	We have a strong border protections. But the main point I want to make is that what Trump is doing through his racism and his xenophobia is demonizing a group of people. And as president I will end that demonization. If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path in my view they are not criminals.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737397	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	They are people fleeing violence. And I think the main thing that we've got to do--among many others--Beto made this point--we got to ask ourselves, why are people walking 2000 miles to a strange country where they don't know the language? So what we will do the first week we are in the White House is bring the entire hemisphere together to talk about how we (INAUDIBLE) Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737398	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--so people do not have to flee their own countries.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737399	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	I think that what we have to do is we have to be an America that is clear about what we want to do with immigration. We need to expand legal immigration, we need to create a path for citizenship not just for dreamers. But for grandmas and for people who have been working here in the farms	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737401	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	We need to fix the crisis at the border. And a big part of how we do that is we do not play into Donald Trump's hands.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737409	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, I--two things. A sane immigration policy moves the comprehensive immigration reform. It (INAUDIBLE) to a humane border policy in which, by the way, we have enough administrative judges so that we don't have incredible backlogs that we have right now. But, to answer your question, I happen to believe that when I talk about healthcare as a human right that applies to all people in this country. And under a Medicare for All, single payer system, we could afford to do that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737410	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Well, this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community, too, far too many times. It's the worst part of being mayor, getting the phone call, consoling grieving parents. And we have a mass shootings worth of killings every day in this country. What we're doing hasn't worked because we haven't had a system in Washington capable of delivering what the American people have told us they want. Eighty--90 percent of republicans want universal background checks, not to mention the common sense solutions, like red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers and flag mental health risks and an end to assault weapons. Things like what I carried overseas in uniform that have no business in American neighborhoods in peace time, let alone anywhere near a school.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737416	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Well, this is the fundamental nonsense of government. Another thing--another place where despite our best efforts we can't seem to make any progress and when I went to the--to the movie theater in Aurora in 2012 and saw that footage of what happened, back crime scene I will never forget it and we decided you know that we were going to go out and take on the--the NRA and we passed as a purple state we passed universal background checks. We limited magazine capacity. We did the basic work that for whatever reason doesn't seem to be able to get done in Washington.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737417	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	This isn't just about a system or it's not just about words. This is a about the NRA. I have sat across from the president of the United States after Parkland because I have been a leader on these issues and have the bill to close the boyfriend loophole and I watched and wrote down when nine times he said he wanted universal background checks. The next day he goes and he meets with the NRA and he folds. As you are president I will not fold. I will make sure that we get universal background checks passed, the assault weapons ban, that we do something about magazines and that we understand when that six little--little six-year-old boy died, Stephen Romero, when his dad said he is only six years old all I can say is--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737418	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	All I can say is he is six years old.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737419	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	We have to remember that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737420	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	This is the exact same conversation we've been having since--since I was in high school. I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened. I was part of the first generation that saw a routine school shootings. We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country. We dare not allow there to be a third. Something is broken if it is even possible for the same to bait around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do. They won't prevent every incident, they won't save every life but we know what to do and it has not happened.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737421	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	Yes. What is broken is a political system that allows the NRA and other large big money to come in and make things not happen when the majority of people are for it. The people are with us now. After Parkland those students just didn't March, they talk to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family and they said there must be a better way. Then we elected people in the house of representatives and guess what? It changed and they passed universal background checks and now that bill is sitting on Mitch McConnell's doorstep because of the money and the power of the NRA. As president I will take them on.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737422	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	This is not about systems and words.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737423	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	how else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence? A number that no of their country comes even close to that we know what all of the solutions are and yet nothing has changed? It is because in this country money buys influence, access and increasingly outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place. As president we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of Congress or any candidate for federal office. We will listen to people, not packs, people not corporations, people not special interests.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737424	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	I think we have got to do--I think what I meant is what President Obama said in that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have a solution to the crisis. Now, I come from one of the most rural states in America. I have a D- voting record from the NRA, and as president, I suspect it will be an F record. What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA. You asked me about my record back in 1988 coming from a state that had no gun control. I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election. I will do everything I can not only to take on the NRA, but to expand and create universal background checks, do away with the straw man provision, do away with the gun show loophole, and do away with the loopholes now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737425	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Still the conversation that we've been having for the last 20 years. Of course we need to get money out of politics. But when I proposed the actual structural democratic reforms that might make a difference and the electoral college, amend the Constitution if necessary, to clear up Citizens United, have DC actually be a state and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform, people look at me funny as if this country were incapable of structural reform. Does anybody really think we're going to overtake Citizens United without constitutional action? This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737426	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	And you are telling me we can't reform our democracy--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737433	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	I'm saying that policies of this notion that you're going to take private insurance away from 180 million Americans who many of them don't want to give it--many of them do want to get rid of it but some don't. Many don't. Are you going to--the Green New Deal makes sure that every American is guaranteed a government job if they want. That is a disaster. You might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump. I think we got to focus on where Donald Trump is failing. You know, the word malpractice this is interesting I always thought of this as doctors or lawyers it's you know, (INAUDIBLE) proper illegal professional activity for doctors, lawyers or public officials. Google it. Check it out. Donald Trump is malpractice personified. We got to point that out why is it soybean farmers in--in Iowa need 10 good years to get back to where they were two years ago? Where is the manufacturing jobs that are supposed to come back? Why are we lurching from one international crisis to another? All things that he promised American voters. We got to focus on that and the economy and jobs and training so that we can promise a future for America that everybody wants to invest in.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737434	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, the truth is that every credible poll that I have seen has me beating Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

And the reason we are going to defeat Trump and beat him badly he is a fraud and a phony and we are going to expose him for what he is.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

Us governors and mayors are the ones that we have to pick up all the pieces when suddenly the government is supposed to take over all these responsibilities and there's no preparation--the details on what you can't just spring a plan on the world an expect it to succeed.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737441	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	John, I was a mayor and I transformed my city. I have some practical experience. Second of all, interestingly enough today is the anniversary of Medicare. 54 years ago under Linda Johnson and a democratic congress they started a new program after one year--19 million elderly people in it. Please don't tell me that in a four year period we cannot go from 65 down to 55 to 45 to 35. This is not radical. This is what virtually every other country on earth does.

737444	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	And the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 countries. No matter how red or rural we did not write you off. No matter how blue or urban we did not take you for granted and we didn't trim our sales either. We had the courage of our convictions talking about universal healthcare, comprehensive immigration reform and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late.

I took on giant banks and I beat them. I took on Wall Street and CEOs and their lobbyists and their lawyers and I beat them. I took on a popular republican incumbent senator and I beat him. I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn't get elected. Shoot, I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn't get elected, but here's where we are. I get it. There is a lot at stake and people are scared. But, we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else. And we can't ask other people to vote for a candidate we don't believe in. Democrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it. I am not afraid. And for democrats to win, you can't be afraid either.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

They've made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms. Why? Not because they're trying to track your healthcare. They just want one more excuse to say no.

And no, do I think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of America off of their current insurance in four years? No, I don't think we are going to do that. I think there is a better way to get what we all want to see which is lower cost for healthcare. Do I think that we are going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids? No, I--I don't think we are going to do that. So that is what I am talking about but what I don't like about this argument right now--what I don't like about it at all is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election and I think--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

As a member of Congress when I learned that the El Paso VA had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country meaning that care delayed functionally became care tonight and was related to the suicide epidemic, we made it our priority and we turned around the VA in El Paso. We took that lesson nationally and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand mental health care to veterans and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing, Donald Trump, to show at the end of the day we will put the American people first--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

So I have proposed putting $2 trillion in so we do the research. We then say anyone in the world can use it so long as you build it right here in America.

We can create millions of good paying jobs. We can build communities in rural America that have been devastated. So we are not antiworker. We are going to provide and make sure that those workers have a transition to new jobs (INAUDIBLE) healthcare and education.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737489	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	I've listened to scientists on this and they are very clear--we don't have more than 10 years to get this right. And we won't meet that challenge with half steps or half measures or only half the country. We got to bring everyone in. The people of Detroit and those that I listened to in Flint last week--they want the challenge. They want those jobs. They want to create the future for this country and the world. Those community college students I met in Tucumcari, New Mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest growing jobs in the country and those farmers in Iowa say pay me for the environmental services of planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements. That's how we meet the challenge. We do it with everyone in this country. We bring everyone into the solution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

Nominate me and we will have a different conversation with American voters about why the President of the United States thinks you're a sucker.

And they are still drinking bottled water in that town and that is outrageous. So my plan and I am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan and I did that because this is a bread and butter issue.

737494	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	(INAUDIBLE) traffic jams. I think the governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan fix the damn roads and it is an issue for union jobs and so I think what we need to do is not have a precedent that has promised he was going to do that on election night if anyone reads members and then he hasn't followed through. He has done nothing. He blew up the meeting at the White House. I would put $1 trillion into the sand I would pay for it by first of all changing the capital gains rate, by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer as he promised and I would take that money and put it into rural broadband and green infrastructure so you won't have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson-Chalmers neighborhood, the African neighborhood that was African-American neighborhood that was most hit when you had those recent rainstorms. And I truly believe that if we are going to move on infrastructure--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

It doesn't just offend our sensibilities to hear him say send her back about a member of Congress because she's a woman of color, because she's a Muslim American. Doesn't just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants rapist and criminals or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over or from every tradition of faith. It is also changing this country. Hate crimes are on the rise every single one of the last three years.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election but we must also ensure that we don't just tolerate or respect our differences but we embrace them. That is what we have learned in El Paso, Texas, my hometown, one of the safest cities in the United States of America not despite but because it is a city of immigrants and asylum seekers and refugees. We will show that our--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737499	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Well the core value behind this entire country's history is working towards a more perfect union, that all people are created equal and we have fallen far away from that. I think the job is incumbent on any one of us to make the convincing case that we can deliver an urban agenda that represents progress in schools. You know Colorado when I was mayor we got to universal pre-K for every kid in the urban city. We did major police reform 10 years before Ferguson. Why is it now that five years after Ferguson we still don't have anything? How do we get affordable housing? We create a scholarship fund for every kid. You've got to deliver a vision like that for the whole country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

So, I have a plan, for example, on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids, but we've got to acknowledge what's happened on race. So, my plan have universal tuition free college for all of our kids, but also increases the Pell Grant and levels the playing field by putting $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.

737505	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	It cancels student loan debt for 95 percent of the kids with student loan debt and helps close the black-white wealth gap in America.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737506	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	As an urban mayor serving a diverse community, the racial divide lives within me. I'm not saying that I became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch. But, in our city, we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing and so, we directed it to a high--historically underinvested African American neighborhood. Right now, in the wake of a police-involved shooting, our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use of force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737507	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	I proposed a Douglas Plan to tackle this issue nationally because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action. Systemic racism has touched every part of American life, from housing to health, to home ownership. If you walk into an emergency room and you are black, your reports of pain will be taken less seriously. If you apply for a job and you are black, you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume. It's why I've proposed that we do everything from investing in historically red line neighborhoods--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737510	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	Well, first of all, there are vo--people that voted for Donald Trump before that aren't racist. They just wanted a better shake in the economy. And so, I would appeal to them. But, I don't think anyone can justify what this president is doing. Little kids literally woke up this weekend, turned on the TV and saw their president calling their city, the town of Baltimore, nothing more than a home for rats. And I can tell you, as your president, that will stop. The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country. I know that because I have lived it. And that means when we put out there better childcare and better education and we pay teachers more and we make sure there's a decent retirement system in place. Yes, we help the African American community and we must because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what we've seen in the last decade, but we help everyone.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737511	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	So, what I say to the people in my rural parts of my state, just like I say to them in the city and bring them together, is that economic opportunity must be there--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737513	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	I want to acknowledge something that we're all touching on, which is the very foundation of this country, the--the wealth that we have built, the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force.

737515	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	the national conversation we have waited too long in this country to have.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737516	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, I responded to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn's legislation, which is called 10-20-30. And with what that understands is that as a result of slavery and segregation and the institutional racism we see now in healthcare, in education, in financial services, we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African-American communities. In terms of education, I also have a plan. It's called the Thurgood Marshall plan and it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America. It would triple funding for title I schools, it would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $60,000 a year.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737517	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	For decades we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant, multinational corporations to help giant multinational corporations. They have no loyalty to America. They have no patriotism. If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico they'll do it in a heartbeat. If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam they'll do it in a heartbeat. I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says, when are we going to do it that way? We are going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table, with small businesses at the table, with small farmers at the table, with environmentalists at the table. With human rights activists at the table. And then, we are going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to America's markets. They want to sell to you.

737521	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	We need to raise our standards.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

American workers want those jobs. And we can build the trade deals that do it. People want access to our markets all around the world. Then the answer is let's make them raise their standards. Make them pay their workers more. Let their workers unionize. Raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they want to be able to sell their products. Right now, the whole--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737525	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	and we can change that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737526	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	You know the--the question was about tariffs and they are a huge mistake. They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences. When have we ever gone to war including a trade war without allies and friends and partners? As president we will hold China accountable or we will bring our allies and friends like the European Union to bear and we will also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and American workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor, not just here in the United States--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737528	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	I just want to respond to this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737529	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Okay. You are looking I believe that the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA, PM. TR (PH) with China which cost us over 4 million jobs but also helped lead the effort against these agreements.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737530	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Now Elizabeth is absolutely right, if anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker you are mistaken. If they can save five cents--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737531	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--by going to China, Mexico or Vietnam or anyplace else that is exactly what they would do. As president let me tell you what I will do. These guys line up at the federal trough. They want military contracts, they want all kinds of contracts. Well, under my administration you ain't going to get those contracts if you are throwing American workers--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737532	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--out on the street.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737533	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	So I think again I think Congressman Delaney has got a point here and there is a way of looking at--at trade that is therapeutic. The bottom line is you talk to any economist, there is not a single example in history where a trade war had a winner. Trade wars are for losers and the bottom line is we have got to recognize let's negotiate a better trade deal but you are not going to win against China in a trade war when they've got 25% of our total debt. And step back and look at here Trump gives that giant tax cut and at the same time so we are paying in tariffs about $800-$1200 per household and then we give this incredible tax cut to the rich. Essentially what is happening is now he has transferred that tax obligation on to the middle class. That is what's outrageous but tariffs are not the solution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737534	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn't understand what's going on. Look at the new NAFTA 2.0. What's the central feature? It is to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians, Americans and Mexicans more money and make more profits. That is what trade deals have become. They have become a way for giant multinationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind. We have to have the courage to fight back against that corruption.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737535	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Don, can I say something--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737536	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	What just happened in my community 20 years before I was born and when I was growing up we were still picking up the pieces. Empty factories, empty houses, poverty. I know exactly what happens to a community when these closures take place and there will be more. It is why we actually need to put the interest of workers first. Of course we need to do retraining. We are doing it now in South Bend. We should continue to do it but this is so much bigger than a trade fight. This is about a moment when the economy is changing before our eyes. There are people in the gig economy who go through more jobs in a week then my parents went through in their lifetime. It is why I have propose that we allow	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737537	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--Workers to unionize because a gig is a job and a worker is a worker.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737538	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	We have to respond to all of these changes and, you know, in addition to confronting tech, in addition to supporting workers by doubling unionization, as I proposed to do--some of this is low-tech to like the minimum wage is just too low. And so-called conservative Christian senators right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage when Scripture says that whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737539	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	So I have proposed a wealth tax. It's now time to do that. It's time to tax the top one tenth of 1 percent of fortunes in this country. Your first $50 million, you can keep free and clear, but your 50 millionth and first dollar you've got to pitch in two cents. Two cents. What can America do with two cents? We can provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five. We can provide universal child--a pre-k for every three-year-old and four-year-old. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. We can provide universal tuition free college. We can expand Pell, we can put $50 billion into our historically black colleges and universities, and we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it and start to close the wealth gap in America. It tells you how badly broken this economy is--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737544	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	I'd like to respond to this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737545	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	That would be great for us and then the next day, there would be a student loan program and people would be out taking student loans wondering they weren't--why they weren't lucky enough in timing to get theirs right away completely too. We can have debt free college for low and middle income students by expanding Pell grants and compelling states to pick up more of the burden. And on the backend, for those of us who do have a lot of debt, we can make it more affordable and we can expand a public service loan forgiveness program, which is an excellent program that is almost impossible to actually get access to right now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737546	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	We can take these steps and have an approach that is actually fair. If we want to start wiping away student debt, here's where I would start. I would start with the for-profit colleges that took advantage of people, especially veterans, by the way. The moment I redeployed, my Facebook add feed started filling with ads from these for-profit colleges. Under President Obama, they were held accountable for whether they deliver results. President Obama--President Trump, under a Secretary of Education--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737547	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--who, regrettably, is from this state did away with those rules. There's no accountability. On my watch, those colleges that turn the Department of Education into a predatory lender, that's where we would begin when it came to getting rid of loans.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737548	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Matter of fact, I do. But, before I get into that, the major issue that we don't talk about in Congress, you don't talk about in the media is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America. You got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. You got top 1 percent that owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent. Forty-nine percent of all the income goes to the top 1 percent. Companies like Amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax and we've got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737549	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	What we need is a political revolution that tells these billionaires and corporate America that they are Americans, they'll participate in our society, but they have got to start paying their fair share of taxes, period.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737550	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	I support free two year college. Earn that associate's degree, realize your full potential, debt free four year college. But, unlike some of other candidates on the stage, that's not just for tuition, that is room and books and board, the full cost of being able to better yourselves so that you can better this country. And then for that school teacher, who in many places like Texas, is working a second or a third job, full forgiveness for her outstanding student loan debt.

737551	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	I want to make it easier for kids to go to college and I think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most. And my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids, for Wall Street kids to go to college. There's no difference. It says everyone is free. I don't think that makes sense. And I am very concerned if we do things like that, the debt we're going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation. So, what I would do about student loan debt is that I would allow people to refinance it at a better rate and I would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them so that you literally over five, 10 years can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we don't have enough workers.

I just think you have to leave open the possibility of meeting with anyone at any place. What I don't like is how this president has handled it. You've heard of the Truman Doctrine, the Manuel Doctrine. He's done the go it alone doctrine with the rest of the world. He's taken us out of the climate change agreement, out of the Iran nuclear agreement, out of the Russian nuclear agreement and I don't agree with that. And when he was just with Vladimir Putin at the G20 when he was asked about invading our democracy he made a joke--hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote. Four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama lost their life in a church at the height of the civil rights amendment. So, I do believe you meet with people but you better have an agenda.

But I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan. When I thought I was turning out the lights years ago. Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan I think about what it was like to hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with--somebody that I knew, a friend, roommate, colleague. We're pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on 9/11. I was sent into that war by a congressional authorization as well as a president. And we need to talk not only about the need for president committed to ending endless wars. But the fact that congress has been asleep on the switch.

There is no reason for us to be at work all over the world tonight.

Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe and what is happening right now with Donald Trump is they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons, the different ways that they could be used puts us all at risk.

Our military is the best on earth but we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution.

That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk right in the middle of this. At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world has pulled us out of the deal in neuron and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon.

Leaders like the--I actually think it's good that the Prime Minister of New Zealand has gotten a lot of attention in democratic debates. She's masterful. She is younger than I would be when I take office. This is the kind of trend America might be leading instead of following, but only if it's actually backed by the right vision and we can have great presidents at any age.

737581	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	What I will say is we need the kind of vision that's going to win. We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal. The only reason we got this president is that normal didn't work. We have to be ready to take on this president and, by the way, something that hasn't been talked about as much tonight, take on his enablers and in Congress. You know, when--when David Duke--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737582	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	When David Duke ran for Congress, ran for governor, the Republican Party 20 years ago ran away from him. Today, they are supporting naked racism in the White House, or at best, silent about it. And if you are watching this at home and you are a Republican member of Congress, consider the fact that when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story of all the good and bad things you did in your life, the thing you will be remembered for is whether in this moment with this president, you found the courage to stand up to him or you continued to put party over country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737583	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, Pete is right. It's a question of vision. That's what it is, whether you're young, whether you're old, whether you are in between. And my vision, among other things, says that if we're going to fight for healthcare, we don't take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies. And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who, in my view, are going to war against the American people in terms of healthcare. That's a new vision. A new vision says that we must cancel completely student that because the younger generation in this country today, for the first time in modern American history, will have a lower standard of living than their parents.

737585	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Thank you and what a night. I loved it. I'd like to ask every American to imagine that you are facing life threatening surgery tomorrow. Would you choose a doctor that had a track record with proven success who had actually done the work? Or someone who just talked about it? That's the question we are facing in this primary. I've actually got track record as a small business owner and as a mayor and as a governor. We expanded healthcare in Colorado. We've got near universal coverage. We fought climate change directly. We beat the NRA. And for the last three years we have been the number one economy in the country. We can map all that out.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737587	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	Thank you, Detroit. To win we have to listen to people. And out there today is Casey Joe's mom. Casey Joe was a champion high school swimmer form a small town. She got sick. Went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids. The last thing that she said to her mom was momma it's not our fault and she died. A lot of Americans say the same thing every day and that is what I will stand up for and what I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didn't tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen we need someone that has people's back. We also need someone that can win. And I have won in these red districts. I win in the Midwest. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Michigan and Iowa. I also will do my job without fear or favor just like I did as a prosecutor and get through the gridlock like I've done as a senator where I've passed over 100 bills where I've been the lead democrat. And last, yes, I will govern with integrity. We have the President where people turn off their TV when they see him. Not me. I will make you proud as your president.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737588	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been. And right now, we have a president who uses fear to try to drive us further apart. To meet this challenge we have to have hope in one another and a faith in the future of this country that includes everyone. My whole life I've been including people in the success of this country. Starting a small business with high value, high wage, high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban country in America. Serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day. And in congress being in the minority but working with democrats and republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country. And then in Texas this last year--traveling to every country. Not writing anybody off. Not taking anyone for granted. And at the end of the day winning more votes than any democrat had in the history of the state. Winning independence for the first time in decades and winning nearly half a million republicans. And those 38 electoral college votes in Texas are now in play and I can win them. That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021. Thank you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737589	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	There's good news and bad news. I'm going to start with the bad news--our country is in trouble. GDP is going up and life expectancy is going down. Think about what that means. It is only getting tougher. By 2030 we will have passed the point of no return on climate. There will be 130 million more guns on our streets. I'll be in my 40s then. If you have kids--think about how old they will be then. But here's the good news--it's not too late. We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time--just before we ran out of time in 2020 we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn't have to wonder if it could support us. To deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcements. That we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats. We can do this if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn't worked with bold action and win--not only defeat this president but defeat as congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican party with its conscience as well as bringing democrats to office. Join me and let's make it happen.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

But my daddy ended up as a janitor and by the time I graduated from high school my family didn't have the money to send me off to college. My big chance was what was then a commuter college that cost $50 a semester. For me what this election is all about is opportunity. Every budget, every policy that we talk about is a about who is going to get opportunity. Is it going to go to the billionaires or is it going to go to our kids?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737591	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Right now for decades we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful. It has been on the side of the wealthy and that means it has not been on the side of everyone else. Not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, people living in small farms and small communities across this country. How do we beat it? We beat it by being the party of big structural change. Give people a reason to show up and vote and we beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country, not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires but actually building it person by person across this country with small dollar donations, with volunteers, with people who show up and say I have a stake in this democracy.

As president, I will bring the spirit of real patriotism to the White House, serving the interests of all Americans, not just the rich and powerful. I'll fight for our rights and freedoms of all Americans, upholding these principles in our Constitution upon which our country was founded. Fighting for justice and equality for all, fighting for every single American, regardless of race or religion as we strive towards that a more perfect union.

I know this may sound like a gimmick, but this is a deeply American idea from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King to today. Let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it. Why do we need to do it? We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next. If you don't believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit.

We need a nation that understands these tired old language the--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470079	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Donald Trump from Baltimore to even the border is using the tired old language of demigods, of fear mongers, of racists to try to divide our country against itself. We know who Donald Trump is. But in this election the question is--who are we as a people? We have serious problems in America. We have deep wounds and seriously deeply rooted challenges. We desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward. Because we know in this country that our fates are united. That we have a common destiny. The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose. That's how we will beat Donald Trump. That's how I will beat Donald Trump. And as your president, that's how I will govern and move us forward together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470080	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	This is an inflection moment in the history of our country. I think we all know that. This is a moment in time that is requiring us each as individuals and collectively to look in a mirror and ask a question. That question being, who are we? And I think most of us know that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this. So, this then becomes a moment that we must fight for the best of who we are and fight of course, we will. And this is not a new fight for us as Americans. We have always been prepared to fight for our ideas. We have always been a nation that fights for the best of who we are. And I tell you, I come from fighters. My parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement. My sister Maya and I joke, we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults, which meant full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice. And I am prepared to march with you, to fight with you to be the best of who we are and to successfully prosecute the case of four more years of Donald Trump and against him.

470081	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Tonight, I think democrats are expecting some engagement and I expect we'll get it. I'm running for president to restore the soul in our country. We have a president that everyone has acknowledged here, every day is ripping at the social fabric of our country. No one man has the capacity to rip that apart. It's too strong. We're too good. Just look at this stage made up of very diverse people from diverse backgrounds went on to be mayors, senators, congressman, members of the cabinet and yes, even the vice president. Mr. President, this is America. And we are strong and great because of this diversity, Mr. President.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470082	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Not--not in spite of it, Mr. President. Mr. President let's get something straight. We love it. We are not leaving it. We are hear to stay and we are certainly not going to leave it to you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470083	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Well, they're probably confused because they haven't read it. But the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families, listening to experts, listening to healthcare providers and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people. Responsive to their needs of understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long. That American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and--and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy. I listen to the American families that say four years is not enough to transition into this new plan so I devised a plan where it is going to be 10 years of a transition --	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470084	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I listened to American families who said I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So, I designed a plan where, yes, responsive to the needs of American families. There will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare because the bottom line is this, we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And in America today, far too many people--in fact, 30 million people--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470085	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--are going without access to healthcare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470086	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Well, my response is that the senator's had several plans so far and any time someone tells you you're going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years. If you notice, there's no talk about the fact that the plan, in 10 years, will cost $3 trillion. You will lose your employer-based insurance. And in fact, you know, this is the single most important issue facing the public. And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can't beat President Trump with double talk on this plan.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470087	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Absolutely. Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing. The reality is that our plan will bring healthcare to all Americans under a Medicare for All system. Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day. Babies will be born into our plan. And right now, 4 million babies almost are born every day in America--or every year in America. Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470088	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Your plan, by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans. So, I think that you should really think about what you're saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to healthcare and do not want cost to be their barrier to getting it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470089	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	The plan, no matter how you cut it, costs $3 trillion when it is, in fact, employed, number one. Ten years from now, after two terms of the senator being president. After her time. Secondly, it will require middle class taxes to go up, not down. Thirdly, it will eliminate employer-based insurance. And fourthly, what happens in the meantime?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470090	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I'd like to respond. First of all, the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive. Second, we are now paying $3 bill--trillion a year for healthcare in America. Over the next 10 years, it's probably going to be $6 trillion. We must act. My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage. Right now, in America, we have seniors who every day--millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need. All people should have access to healthcare and--and cost should not be their barrier.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470091	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Thank you. I don't know what the vice president and senator are talking about. The folks I talk to about health insurance say that their health insurance isn't working for them. There's tens of millions of Americans don't even have health insurance. Tens of millions more--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470092	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	--who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the copays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses. There's this mythology that somehow all these folks are in love with their insurance in America. What I hear from union members and from hard working middle class people is they wish they had better insurance. And they're angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage, like mental health care--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470095	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	My response is Obamacare is working. The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare. Go back and do--take aw--take back all the things that Trump took away, provide a public option, meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into the option. If they didn't they like their employer plan or if they're on Medicaid, they'd automatically in the plan. It would be--take place immediately. It would move quickly and it would insure the vast, vast, vast majority of Americans.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470096	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	In the mean time, what happens? Did anybody tell you how much their plans cost? My plans cost $750 billion. That's what it cost. Not $30 trillion.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470097	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	In response to Senator Biden about the Affordable Care Act it is important that you understand that our Medicare for all plan has actually by the architect of the Obama Affordable Care Act been described as one of the most effective ways to bring health care to all, Kathleen Sebelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470098	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	In terms of the point that--that Senator Gillibrand is raising I couldn't agree more. Senator Biden, your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with the status quo doing business as usual and that is going to be about jacking up co-pays, jacking up deductibles - Max	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470099	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	It will still be the situation--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470100	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--that people going to an emergency room have to come out $5000.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470101	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	My plan makes the limit of co-pay to be $1000 because we further support the--the--the ability to buy into the Obama care plan. Secondly, the idea that this is somehow a bad idea, no one has to keep their private insurance, but if they like their insurance, they should be able to keep it. Nothing is demanding in my plan that there be private insurance. It says if the 160 million people who have it say they like their employer insurance they should have a right to have it. If they don't they can buy into the Biden plan which is Obama care--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470102	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Well, first of all, let me just say that the person that's enjoying this debate the most right now is Donald Trump as we pit Democrats against each other while he is working right now--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470103	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	--to take away America's healthcare. There is a court case working through the system that is going to get the Affordable Care Act and actually got protections on pre-existing conditions. And so I was raised by two civil rights parents who told me always keep your eyes on the prize and that is that in the United States of America every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to health care, that it is a human right and how we get there it has to be to end this broken system because we are on our way in just a handful of years of literally spending 20 percent of our economy, one out of every five dollars spent on healthcare and we spend more than every other nation on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs, multiple more than other country--multiple more than other countries.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470104	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	And so you want to know what I'm going to do, I'm going to work to get as to a point where Medicare for all where everyone is covered but this pitting against progressives and against moderates saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn't care enough that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in face of the real enemy here.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470105	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	And I am going to keep fighting for that end.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470106	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	The reality is right now; we don't have a health care system. We have a sick care system, and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it. So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies who have been profiting off the backs of sick people have a seat at the table writing this legislation.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470107	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	Now Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sebelius who helped write her bill. This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal. Kathleen Sebelius works for Medicare advantage, private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan. If we are seeking to really reform our healthcare system, we've got to shut out big insurance and big Pharma out of the drafting process so they cannot continue to profit off of the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470108	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Well, unfortunately, representative Gabbard got it wrong. Kathleen (INAUDIBLE) did not write my plan, she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyone is going to have access to health care in America and when we talk about this again I--I am going to go back to Vice President Biden because your plan does not cover everyone in America by your staffs and your own definition 10 million people, as many as 10 million people will not have access to health care and in 2019 in America for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone I think is without excuse. Our plan covers everyone--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470109	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--and gives people choice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470110	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	--Does cover--will cover everyone. Number one. Number two, the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling and drug prices. The bio pharma is now where things are going to go. It's no longer chemicals. It's about all these breakthroughs we've had with the dealing with the whole, excuse me, immune system. And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in the HHS and says as you develop a drug, you've got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for. We will set the price. And secondly, it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on and the--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470111	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I--I would like to respond.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470112	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Well, I know that this is something very personal for all Americans. You know, I grew up with that grandmother that hide diabetes and I watched as her condition got worse and worse. That whole time she had to Medicare. I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it and then expand it to anybody who wants it. I also believe though that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong that they want to hold on to that they should be able to do that. What I don't believe is that the profit motive of big Pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine in our great nation whether somebody gets healthcare or not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470113	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Well, first of all, with all due respect to my friend, Michael Bennett, my plan is--does not offer anything that is illegal. What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare, meaning that where you work will not be--the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work. I have met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like where they are not prospering simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides. It's time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get. And under my plan, we do that. As it relates to the insurance and the pharmaceutical companies--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470114	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--Who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by Senator Biden--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470117	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	He--we cannot keep with the Republican talking points on this. You've got to stop. The reality is that what--under my Medicare for all plan, yes, employers not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get. They will be able to make that decision. Private insurance companies and private carriers, if they comply by our rules and play by our rules, will be able to offer those employees health care coverage under your private Medicare plan or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan. But is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only. They want choice and my plan gives that to them.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470118	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	I just want to share a story. When I told my wife I was running for president you know, the first question she asked me? What are we going to do about our healthcare? That's a true story and it's not just us. Democrats are talking about our healthcare in the wrong way. As someone who has run a business I can tell you flat out our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire, it makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees, it makes it harder to switch jobs as Senator Harris just said and it is certainly a lot harder to start a business. If we say look, we are going to get healthcare off the backs of businesses and families then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom. That's the argument we should be making to the American people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470119	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	I don't understand why democrats on this stage are fear mongering about universal healthcare. It makes no sense. Ask the American people--they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them. Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies. They feel they are holding back their families because they can't get the coverage they need. They get a lot of nos. They don't get a lot of health from health insurance companies.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470120	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold? That says, we don't need to be dependent on private insurance. We can have a system that actually covers everyone. You know what? Donald Trump won this state of Michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo. How about we be the party that's going to disrupt the status quo for working people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470121	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Certainly, with all due respect to Senator Bennet, what he is saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes.

If we say that then there is an election. The American people get to decide. The ultimate choice, Senator, is an election. And this should be the party that stands for universal healthcare and says, we are not going to accept anything less. Right now in America so many people don't have the healthcare they need. That is a fact. 10s of millions of people including middle class people. Give them a chance--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat. 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. And in fact, what we got is a public option that in fact, would allow anybody to buy in. No one has to keep their private insurance. They can buy into this plan. And they can buy into it with a thousand dollar deductible and never have to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income when they do it. And if they don't have any money they get in free.

Let's talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year alone profited $72 billion, and that is on the backs of American families, and under your plan status quo, you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families.

470148	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	The fact is what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum. That woman, the women she spoke to are entitled to asylum. That is not crossing the border illegally. What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly. With regard to seven--with regard to the secretary's point, I already proposed and passed	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

In addition to that, we're in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border, what do you say to all those people around the world who, in fact, want the same thing, to come to the United States and make their case, but they don't--that they--they have to wait in line? The fact of the matter is you should be able to--if you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back. It's a crime. It's a crime. And it's not one that, in fact--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470150	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Yeah. First of all, Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn't. Let me begin by telling you	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470151	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Let me just start out by answering that question. My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470152	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	--I agree--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470153	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	--Because we do have a problem with that. Secondly, the only way that we're going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations don't happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law. There's still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border. It's a civil action. Also, we have 654 miles of fencing. We have thousands of personnel at the border. We have planes. We have boats--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470157	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense. Here's the deal. The fact of the matter is that in fact, when people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum. People should have to get in line. That's the problem. And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump. We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

We will have to stop separating children from their parents, make it so that it's easier for people to seek asylum in this country, make sure that we are securing our borders, and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470160	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	I am the son of immigrants myself. My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 U.S. patents for GE and IBM. I think that's a pretty good deal for the United States. That's the immigration story we need to be telling. We can't always be focusing on some of the--the--the distressed stories. And if you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants, you will find wall-to-wall robots and machines. Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470161	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Absolutely. First of all, I just want to say again tonight, we are playing into Republican hands--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470162	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	--who have a very different view and they're trying to divide us against each other. I'm listening to the language of my colleagues. No, Mr. Vice President, we are not going to just let people cross the border. An unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing if you do it in the civil courts or if you do it through the criminal courts. But the criminal courts is what is getting Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country who no one surrenders their human rights.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470163	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	And so doing it through the civil courts means that you won't need these awful detention facilities that I have been to, seen children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children, this is not necessary. We have seen using the civil system piloted programs that have 100 percent compliance with the civil courts where people are evaluated. If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned. If they are, like the people I met in Juarez, who were survivors of sexual assault who we wouldn't even let come and present for asylum. We are butchering our values--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470164	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	--And making ourselves less safe.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470165	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	I agree with the senator. The asylum process is a real process and this president is ruining it. It has nothing to do with that section of the law. That's what he's doing. Number one. Number two, we should in fact, and we have proposed and we tried to get it passed in our administration, I proposed significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants that are able to come. This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people. And the reason we are the country we are is we been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture. Immigrants built this country. That's why we are so special. It took courage, it took resilience, it took absolute confidence for them to come and we should be encouraging--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470166	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	--people. And by the way, anybody across that crosses the stage with a--with a PhD should get a green card for seven years. We should keep them here.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470167	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Two points. One, it's all kind of a charade because there's 11 million people here and everyone in theory has broken the law, but they're part of our communities now. They're part of our economy. They are our neighbors. Why are we even discussing on one level whether it's a civil penalty or criminal penalty when it's in American reality? And what we need is comprehensive immigration reform once and for all to fix it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470168	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Second, Vice President Biden, I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations. You are vice president of the United States. I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not using your power, your influence in the White House. Did you think it was a good idea or did you think it was something that needed to be stopped?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470169	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	The president came along and he's the guy that came up with the idea, first time ever, of dealing with the Dreamers. He put that in the law. He--he talked about a comprehensive plan which he put on the--label for the Congress saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people. He said we should up the number of people that were able to bring into this country. Lastly, he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it where people were leaving in the first place. So he did--compare him to Donald Trump, I think is absolutely bizarre.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470170	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	I don't. I think it's important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as they have been living in the shadows. And instead of putting a band aid on this problem--fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenship so that they are no longer treated as second class citizens in this country. We have got to look at the challenge that people all across this country are facing under crushing student debt. This is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way. And I believe that it is our generation that has the bold, creative solutions to be able to solve it. This is about promise for our future. And we've got to make those kind of investments.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470171	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	I agree with the Congresswoman, but I don't hear an answer from the Vice President I'm confused. I asked the Vice President point blank did he use his power to stop those deportations. He went right around the question. Mr. Vice President, you want to be President of the United States. You need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you if you're debating Donald Trump, he's not going to let you off the hook. So, did you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the President and say, this is a mistake--we shouldn't do it? Which one?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470172	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	I was Vice President. I am not the President. I keep my recommendation in private. Unlike you I expect you would say what everyone said privately with him, but it's not what I do. What I do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system. That's what he did. That's what he did. And much more has to be done. Much more has to be done.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470173	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	I still don't hear an answer.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470174	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Well, couple things--first of all, Mr. Vice President, you can't have it both ways. You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can't do it when it's convenient.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470175	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	And then dodge it when it's not. And then the second thing, and this really irks me because I heard the Vice President say that--you got a PhD you can come right into this country. Well, that's playing into what the republicans want--to pit some immigrants against other immigrants.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470176	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Some are from shithole countries and some are from (INAUDIBLE) countries. We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity and this should be a country that honors everyone. Don't let the republicans divide this party against itself.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470177	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	The fact is--that's what I said about this country. We are a country of immigrants, all of us. All of us. Some here came against their will. Others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives and they did. The (INAUDIBLE) that's what we're talking about. That's what made us great. And the fact of the matter is I think the President of the United States, Barack Obama, went out of his way to change the system and he got pushed back significantly.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470178	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Well I don't--I think he is wrong and I think we should work together. He has a similar plan. I think that we should change the way we look at prisons.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470179	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Right now we are in a situation where when someone is convicted of--of a drug crime they end up going to jail and to prison. They should be going to rehabilitation; they shouldn't be going to prison. When in prison, they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470180	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	And when they get out of prison they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they would have had be for including Pell grants for education, including making sure that they are able to have housing, public housing, including they have all of the opportunities that were available to them because we want them to become better citizens.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470181	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	That is the essence of what my plan in detail lays out. I'm happy to discuss it or in detail, if the Senator would want to. And so I--you know, I--I look--anyway. That's what I think my plan--I know what my plan does, and I think it's not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done.

There was nothing done to deal with the police department that was corrupt.

They are waiting for justice and they're going to get justice. There's finally going to be injustice, I have confidence in that, in the next 30 days in New York. You know why? Because for the first time, we are not waiting on the federal Justice Department, which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the Justice Department was pursuing their prosecution. And years went by and a lot of pain accrued. And in the meantime, what I'm making working on is making sure, and I have for five years, there will never be another tragedy, there will never be another Eric Garner because we are changing fundamentally how we police.

470214	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	I speak for just about everyone watching when I say I would trust anyone on this stage much more than I would trust our current president on matters of criminal justice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470215	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	We cannot tear each other down. We have to focus on beating Donald Trump in 2020. I want to share a story that a prison guard, a corrections officer in New Hampshire said to me. He said we should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when they were behind bars. Right now we think we are saving money--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470216	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	We just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways. We should put money directly into people's hands, certainly when they come out of prison, but before they go to prison.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470217	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	That is simply false. And let's be very clear about this. When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate working with segregationists to oppose busing, which was the vehicle by which we would integrate America's public schools--had I been in the United States Senate at that time, I would've been completely on the other side of the aisle. And let's be clear about this. Had those segregationists their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate. Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate. And Barack Obama would not have been in the position to nominate him to the title he now holds.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470218	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	And so, on that issue, we could not be more apart, which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time. Now, I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner because I, too, met with his mother. And one of the things that we've got to be clear about is that this president of the United States, Donald Trump, while he has been in office has quietly been allowing the United--United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees, to stop pattern and practice investigations. On that case, we also know that the--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice said charges should've been filed, but this United States Department of Justice usurped. And I believe it is because that president did not want those charges to go forward and they overrode a decision by the Civil Rights Division of the United States--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470223	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	When Senator Harris was the attorney general for eight years in the State of California, there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country, in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And she did not--in fact, I didn't see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them. Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that, in fact, was abusing people's rights and the fact was that she, in fact, was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me that you, in fact, have been--the police officer did something that did not give you the information would explicate your--your--your client. She didn't do that. She never did it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470224	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	And so, what happened? Along came a federal judge and said, enough, enough, and he freed--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470226	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	That is--is simply not true. And as attorney general of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, I am proud of the work we did, work that has received national recognition for what has been the important work of reforming a criminal justice system. And cleaning up the consequences of the bills that you passed when you were in the United States Senate for decades.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470232	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today. Now, Senator Harris said she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite, but she put over--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470233	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	1500 people in jail for marijuana violations and she laughed about when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470234	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	She brought evidence--she brought evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the State of California. And she fought to keep trash bail system in place. That impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470235	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	As the elected attorney general of California, I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people which became a national model for the work that needs to be done. And I am proud of that work and I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on a floor but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I have to reform a system that is badly in need of reform.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470236	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	That is why we created initiatives that were about re-entering former offenders and getting them counseling.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470237	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	It is why I know that criminal justice system is so broken that I am an advocate for what we need to do.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470239	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a decision and an impact in these people's lives you did not and worse yet, in the case of those who are on death row, innocent people you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470240	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	There is no excuse for that. And the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor you owe them an apology.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470241	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	My entire career I have been opposed, personally opposed to the death penalty and that has never changed. And I dare anybody who is in a position to make that decision to face the people I have faced to say, I will not seek the death penalty. That is my background. That is my work. I am proud of it. I think you can judge people by when they are under fire and it's not about some fancy opinion on a stage. But when they are in a position to actually make the decision, what do they do? When I was in the position on having to decide whether or not to seek a death penalty on cases I prosecuted I made a very difficult decision that was not popular--to not seek the death penalty. History shows that and I am proud of those decisions.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470242	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	I spent seven years running a nonprofit that helped create thousands of jobs including hundreds right here in Detroit as well as Baltimore, Cleveland, New Orleans and I saw that the racial disparities are much, much worse than I had ever imagined. They are even worse still. A study just came out that projected the average American--African-American median net worth will be (INAUDIBLE). So you have to ask yourself how is that possible?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470243	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	It is possible because we are in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in our history. Artificial intelligence is coming. It's going to displace hundreds of thousands of call-center workers, truck drivers, the most common job in 29 states, including this one. And you know who suffers most in a natural disaster. It's people of color, people who have lower levels of capital and education and resources.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470244	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	So what are we going to do about it? We should just go back to the writings of Martin Luther King who in 1967 his book chaos in our communities said we need a guaranteed minimum income in the United States of America. That is the most effective way for us to address racial any quality in a genuine way and give every American a chance in the 21st century economy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470245	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	First of all, the president is a racist, and that was just one more example of it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470246	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	We know that whether it is Baltimore or cities like Detroit they have--they are tremendously rich in history and culture and also in possibility. Here is what I would do if I am president. Number one I would invest in tremendous educational opportunity, invest in universal pre-K for three and four-year-olds, invest in improving K-12 education and also making higher education available to everyone through tuition-free public state universities, community colleges, and job training certification programs.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470247	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	I would follow up on the work that I did at HUD. We passed the most sweeping rule to further desegregate our communities in the United States. This Trump administration set that back. I would put that back in order.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470248	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	I would also invest in housing that is affordable because folks know that the rent is going through the roof.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470249	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	And we need to make sure that you don't have to get out of West Baltimore or inner-city Detroit or the west side of San Antonio or anywhere if you want to reach your American dream. I want you to be able to accomplish it in your great neighborhood where you are.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470250	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	There is no middle ground about my client. The fact of the matter is I called for the immediate action to be taken. First of all, one of things that we--we are responsible for 15 percent of all the pollution in the country. He's right about how it affects people and it affects neighborhoods, particularly poor neighborhoods. But here's the deal, in that area, there's also another piece. 85 percent of it is something I helped to negotiate, and that is the Paris climate accord. I would immediately rejoined that Paris Accord, I would make sure that we up the ante, which it calls for, I would be able to bring those leaders together who I know, I'd--I'd convene them in the White House like we did the nuclear summit, and I would raise the standard.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470251	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	I'd also invest $400 billion--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470254	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	The important number in Vice President Biden's remarks just now is that the United States is only 15 percent of global emissions. We like to act as if we are 100 percent, but the truth is even if we were to curb our emissions dramatically, the earth is still going to get warmer. And we can see it around us this summer. The last four years have been the four warmest years in recorded history. This is going to be a tough truth, but we are too late. We are 10 years too late. We need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction, but we also need to start moving our people to higher ground. And the best way to do that is to put economic resources into your hands so you can protect yourself and your families.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470255	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Yes.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

My plan calls for being--making sure that we have $400 billion invested in technologies and learn how to contain what we're doing, creating 10 million new jobs. We will double offshore wind, we will end any subsidies for coal or any other fossil fuel, but we have to also engage the world while we're doing it. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.

470261	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I mean, I--I have to agree with Governor Inslee and I'm going to just paraphrase one of your great sayings, Governor, which is we currently have a president in the White House who obviously does not understand the science. He's been pushing science fiction instead of science fact. The guy thinks that wind turbines cause cancer, but when in fact it causes jobs, and the reality is that I would take any Democrat on this stage over the current president of the United States who is rolling it back to our collective peril.

470265	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	Well, first of all, this is personal. You can imagine. I grew up in Hawaii, which is the most remote island chain in the world. So, for us, growing up there, protecting our environment was not a political issue. It's a way of life. It's part of our culture. It's part of who we are.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470266	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	This is why, as a member of Congress, long before there was ever a Green New Deal, I introduced the most ambitious climate change legislation ever in Congress called the OFA, Fossil Fuels Act. That actually laid out an actionable plan to take us from where we are today to transition off of fossil fuels and invest in green renewable energy. Invest in workforce training.

470271	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	I'll try harder. Look, the reason why is because, first of all, this problem didn't start yesterday. Science didn't become a reality yesterday. This has been going on for years. There was another president that would not join an international accord. Then, it was the Kyoto Accord. I was mayor then and I stood up national leadership, joining with other mayors to say, climate change is not a separate issue. It must be the issue and the lens with we view every issue. Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris Climate Accords. That is kindergarten.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470272	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	We have to go to far advance and make sure that everything from our trade deals, everything from the billions of dollars we spent to foreign aid, everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential, which is dealing with the climate threat.

We've declared the eradication of all lead, literally ending the notion of lead poisoning once and for all as the goal of our administration and we're doing something about it. Lead poisoning has gone down 90 percent since 2005 and we're going to literally bring it down to zero because we're going to go into every place, buildings, schools, public housing, and take out that lead, remediate that lead once and for all. And that needs to be done all over this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470275	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Now, the federal government used to not take any responsibility for our public housing. For decades, they've been disinvesting in the public housing that was supposed to be a federal responsibility. That's part of why we have this lead crisis to begin with. But, I'll tell you what you do when you're actually in charge of something. I'm in charge of the largest city in this nation. You do not accept the status quo. You fix it.

I was secretary of housing in urban development when Flint had its water crisis. We did what it could to help folks get water filters and then we didn't stop there. We improved the standard of how we deal with elevated lead levels in children. A lot of Americans don't know that this is still a major problem out there. I was back in Flint about six weeks ago and I released a plan to invest $50 billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat. We need to do it. We can do it and I will do it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470279	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Because we did it.

I spent better part of two years out here working to make sure that it did exactly that. We invested significantly in this city and transportation and 20--anyway.

I believe I'm the best candidate suited to beat Donald Trump. And as for how to win in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind. What we have to do is we have to say look, there's record high GDP in stock market prices. You know what also had record highs? Suicides, drug overdoses, depression, anxiety. It has gotten so bad that American life expectancy has declined for the last three years. And I like to talk about my wife who is at home with our two boys right now. One of whom is autistic.

Jake, look, this is one of those times where we are not staring at the truth and calling it out, and this is a case for the Democratic Party the truth will set us free. We lost the state of Michigan because everybody from Republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African-American voters.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470289	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	We need to say that. If the African Americans vote in the state had been like it was four years earlier, we would have won the state of Michigan. We need to have a campaign that is ready for what's coming, and all-out assault especially on the most valuable voter group in our--in fact, the highest performing voting group in our coalition which is black women. And so I would be a person--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470291	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	First of all, Donald Trump came in making a whole lot of promises to working people that he did not keep. He said he was going to help farmers; he said he was going to help auto workers. Farmers are now looking at bankruptcy, soybeans rotting in bills. Autoworkers, we expect perhaps hundreds of thousands will be out of jobs by the end of the year. Jerome Powell just dropped the interest rates, and he admitted why because of the so-called trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the Trump trade tax that has resulted in American families spending as much as $1.4 billion more a month on everything from shampoo to washing machines. He betrayed the American people. He betrayed of American families, and he will lose this election--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470292	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--because folks are clear that he has done nothing except try to beat people down and instead of live people up and that is what we want in the next president of the United States.

470293	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Well, first of all, there are a lot of Americans right now that are hurting. Just go and ask the folks that just received notice that they're going to get laid off by General Motors or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the United States or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can't provide for their families or pay the rent. So the idea that America is doing just fine is wrong. Not only that, this president always likes to take credit like he did this. We've now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history. Over 80 months of that was due to President Barack Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470294	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Thank you, Barack Obama. So you know, I believe that we need to invest in what will ensure that Americans can prosper in the years to come, making sure they had the knowledge and the--and skills to compete in the 21st century economy, ensuring that they can afford the rent where they live and that they have healthcare so that they don't have to worry about going homeless because they can't afford a medical procedure.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470295	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	By pushing for fair trade, not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country, that giveaway American jobs, and that threaten our environment. These are the three main issues with that massive trade deal, the transpacific partnership. I think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass, either a federal law or a state or a local law. This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country, not (SP) to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment. These are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470296	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	I would not because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan, and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers who are already struggling, and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470297	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	I'd renegotiate it. We make up 25 percent of the world's economy. In order--either China is going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are. We have to join with the 40 percent of the world that we had with us, and this time make sure that there's no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there and to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now in the things that make them more competitive. That's what we have to do. Otherwise, they are going to write the rules of the road. We must have the rest of the world joining us to keep them--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade could should be conducted. Otherwise, they're going to do exactly what they're doing, fill the vacuum, and run the--and run the table.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

He's got a new name for it, it's just as dangerous as the old NAFTA, it's going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA like it did to Michigan, and we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA.

470312	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned, particularly in startups and entrepreneurship. We have to do more at every step. And if you're a woman entrepreneur, the obstacles start not just at home, but then when we seek a--a mentor or an investor, often they don't look like you and they might not think your i--idea is the right one.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470313	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitative in abusive jobs and relationships around the country. I'm talking about the waitress who's getting harassed by her boss at the diner who might have a business idea, but right now is stuck where she is. What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses. And the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of $1,000 a month into their hands.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470314	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	It would be a game changer for women around the country because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society.

470315	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I think that's support of my proposal, which is this. Since 1963, when we passed the Equal Pay Act, we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work. Fast forward to the year of our (INAUDIBLE) 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar; black women, 61 cents; Native American women, 58 cents; Latinas, 53 cents. I'm done with the conversation. So, yes, I am proposing in order to deal with this, one, I'm going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work. Two, they will be fined for every 1 percent differential between what they are paying men and women. They will be fined 1 percent of their previous year's profits. That'll get everybody's attention.

470317	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	That was a long time ago and here's what it was about. It would've given people making today $100,000 a year a tax break for childcare. I did not want that. I wanted the childcare to go to people making less than $100,000 and that's what it was about.

470330	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	The fact is that the senator knows that's not my position. Everybody on this stage has been in the Congress, and the Senate or the House has voted for the Hyde amendment at some point. The Hyde amendment in the past was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately. But once I wrote the legislation making sure that every single woman would, in fact, be--have an opportunity to have healthcare paid for by the federal government, everyone, but that could no longer stand. I support a woman's right to choose. I support--it is a constitutional right. I have supported it.

470335	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	A guy that literally tweets out that we are pulling our troops out before his generals even know what about it is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like Afghanistan. And so I will bring our troops home, and I will bring them home as quickly as possible. But I will not set during a campaign an artificial deadline. I will make sure we do it; we do it expeditiously, we do it safely to not create a vacuum that is ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East and perhaps create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation.

470336	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	This is real in a way that is very difficult to convey in words. I was deployed to Iraq in 2005 during the height of the war where I served in a field medical unit where every single day, I saw the high cost of war. Just this past week, two more of our soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. My cousin is deployed to Afghanistan right now. Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan, 14,000 servicemembers are deployed there. This is not about arbitrary deadlines; this is about leadership. The leadership I will bring to do the right thing, to bring our troops home within the first year in office because they shouldn't have been there this long.

470338	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	I would move to de-escalate tensions in Iran because they are responding to the fact that we pulled out of this agreement and it wasn't just us and Iran, there were many other world powers that were part of that multilateral agreement.

What has happened, really? We have fallen apart at home, so we elected Donald Trump, and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our long-standing partners and allies. What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problems right here at home. We spend trillions of dollars and lost thousands of American lives in conflicts that had unclear benefits. We have been in a constant state of war for 18 years. This is not what the American people want. I would bring the troops home, I would de-escalate tensions with Iran, and I would start investing our resources in our own communities.

Listen, we all watched the his testimony. I read the report. There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable. I've seen people go to prison--go to prison for far less. And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice who says the sitting president cannot be indicted. I believe the American people are right there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law including the president of the United States.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470347	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	My response is exactly that. I've read the report. I've read the redacted versions of there report. We have something that is astonishing going on in the United States of America. We have a president that is not acting like a leader of the free world. He is acting like an authoritarian against the actual constitution that he swore an oath to uphold. And so, this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470348	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	I believe that we in the United States congress should start impeachment proceedings immediately.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

Not allowing to subjecting themselves to the checks and balances. He swore an oath to uphold the constitution. The politics of this be damned. When we look back in history at what happened when the president of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world the question is is what will we have done? And I believe that congress should do its job.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470350	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Well, I agree. I was the first of the candidates to call on congress to begin impeachment proceedings. There are 10 different instances that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice. And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings. As to the question of what my Department of Justice might do. I believe with those that say the president should not direct attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470351	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far that you are likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470352	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	I think it's obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worth of impeachment. That I want to caution my fellow democrats while we move when every way we can for impeachment we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives. And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470353	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	We need more talk about working people and their lives. For example, are we really ready--and I ask people on this stage this question-- are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes? That's something every American wants to know about. That's something they want answers to right now. So yeah, move to impeachment but don't forget to do the people's business and stand up for working people because that's how we are actually going to beat Donald Trump. The best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470354	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Let me first say that I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. All of us have a vision for the future of the country that we are articulating to the American people. We continue to do that. We have an election coming up. At the same time senator I think that too many folks in the senate and in the congress have been spooked by 1998. I think that the times are different. In fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursing impeachment. The Mueller report clearly details that he deserves it and what is going to happen in the fall of next year of 2020 if they don't impeach him is he is going to say you see--you see the democrats didn't go after me on impeachment and you know why?

470358	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Thank you. For the last three years, we've watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other, black versus white, citizen versus immigrant, and why? So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else. We can't let them get away with it. If we're going to beat Donald Trump, this has to be a party that stands for something. This has to be the party of labor unions. This has to be the party of universal healthcare. This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470359	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	And when we do that, Donald Trump, right on cue, will call us socialist. Well, here's what I'll say to him. Donald, you are the real socialist. The problem is, it's socialism for the rich. We here in this country, we don't have to take it anymore. We can fight back.

470361	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	Thank you. You know, Donald Trump and warmongering politicians in Washington have failed us. They continue to escalate tensions with other nuclear arm countries, like Russia and China and North Korea, starting a new Cold War, pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. Now, as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us. And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, we would 30 minutes--30 minutes before we were hit and you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say, incoming missile, seek immediate shelter, this is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470362	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	And you would see, as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter. This is the warmonger's hoax. There is no shelter. It's all a lie.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470363	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	As president, I will end this insanity because it doesn't have to be this way. I will end these wasteful regime change wars, work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to deescalate these tensions. And take the trillions of dollars that we've been wasting on these wars and on these weapons and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home. Things like Healthcare for All, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure.

470365	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	You know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate? It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on this stage in polling. It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan, we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show. It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470366	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	We need to be laser focused on solving the real challenges of today. Like the fact that the most common job--jobs in America may not exist in a decade or that most Americans cannot pay their bills. My flagship proposal, the freedom dividend, would put $1000 a month into the hands of every American adult, be a game changer for millions of American families. If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear, enter your zip code at yang2020.com and see what $1000 a month would mean to your community. I have done the math.

They are hosting us today, and one of the reasons I respect the city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark. And Detroit is turning around, and Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demeanor degrade us or underestimate our worth. We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause. That's the history of this city. My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundromat right here in the city. That is the American dream. And so many of us have stories like that, but the dream of this country is under threat right now. Well, my mom's a generation, 80, 95% of baby boomers did better than their parents. It's now just a coin toss for millennials. We have a real crises--crises in our country, and the crises is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470369	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump. Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling. The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him, he wants to take all the oxygen out of the room, it’s when we start focusing on each other and understanding that our common bonds and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before, it's going it's what's going to save us now. That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as president of the United States, not just uniting the Democratic Party, but making sure that we put more indivisible back into this one nation under God.

I've taken on the for-profit colleges who preyed on students, put them out of business. I've preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children, and I will tell you we have a predator living in the White House.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470371	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	And I’m going to tell you something. Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts. And the thing about predators is this, by their very nature, they prey on people they perceive to be weak. They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable. They prey on people who are in need of help, often desperate for help. And predators are cowards.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470372	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years. And let me tell you, we've got a long rap sheet. We’re looking at someone who passed the tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families. We've got a person who has put babies in cages and separated children from their parents. We have someone who passed a so-called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families. So we must defeat him and then, in turning the page, write the next chapter for our country. And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at 3:00 in the morning. And that is my agenda, the 3:00 a.m. agenda that is focused on getting folks the jobs they need, getting their children the education they need, making sure they have the healthcare they need in the future they deserve.

You know on January 20, 2021 at 12:01 PM we are going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101982	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	There will be life after Donald Trump but the truth is that our problems didn't start just with Donald Trump and we won't solve them by embracing old ideas. We need a bold vision, universal pre-K and universal healthcare; unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy; a tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101983	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	But first we have to win and that means exciting a young, diverse coalition of Americans who are ready for a bold future. That is what Kennedy did, it is like Carter did, it is what Clinton did, it is what Barack Obama did and it is what I can do in this race, get back Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia and Arizona and finally turn Texas blue and say goodbye to Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101984	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Good evening Texas Southern. I believe that what unites us up here the 10 of us is much stronger than what divides us and I think that's true of our country, too.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101985	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Now I may not be the loudest person up here but I think we've already got that in the White House. Houston--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101986	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	--we have a problem. This-- we have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101987	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change. And leading the world in taking on climate change. Look, this is the United States of America. There has never been a single, solitary time that we set our minds on something we are unable to do it. We are walking with our heads down like whoa is me. We are the best equipped nation in the world to take this on. It's no longer time to postpone--we should get moving. There's enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101988	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	That will be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think--I think we should have a debate on healthcare. I think I know that the Senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that's been cut, add a public option--guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101989	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for healthcare costs a lot of money--it costs $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion. $3.4 trillion a year it turns out is twice what the entire federal budget is. That's before it exists now without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that's happening. Such far, my distinguished friends the Senator on my left is not--has not indicated how she pays for it and the Senator has, in fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it but it gets him about halfway there.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101990	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	There's a lot of other things that need to be done. I drive a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools that are Title 1 schools from 40 from 15 to $40 billion a year. But I go down the line and each of the things we are talking about I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done and why it's better.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101991	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So, let's be clear about healthcare and let's actually start where Vice President did--we all owe huge debt to President Obama who fundamentally transformed healthcare in America and committed this country to healthcare for every human being.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101992	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	And now, the question is how best can we improve on it? And I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by healthcare at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it those at the very top--the richest individuals and the biggest corporations are going to pay more. And middle class families are going to pay less. That's how this is going to work.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101993	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Look, what families have to deal with is cost. Total cost. That's what they have to deal with and understand, families are paying for their healthcare today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry you can't see that specialist. Every time an insurance company say sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry, we are not covering that prescription. Families are paying every time they don't get a prescription filled because they can't pay for it. They don't have a lump checked out because they can't afford the copay. What we're talking about here is what is going to happen in families' pockets--what's going to happen in their budgets. And the answer is on Medicare for all--costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101994	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	But for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down and--and that's how it should work under Medicare for all in our healthcare (INAUDIBLE).	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101995	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Joe said that Medicare for All would cost over $30 trillion. That's right, Joe. Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing healthcare to every man, woman and child in this country. I wrote the damn bill if I may say so--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101996	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	--intent to eliminate all out of pocket expenses all deductibles, all copayments, nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs because we are going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101997	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	We need--we need a healthcare system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies and to tell you how absurd the system is 10 nine on ABC the healthcare industry will be advertising telling you how bed Medicare for All is because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101998	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	If I could respond? George?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101999	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Okay. Number one, my health care plan does significantly cut the cost of the largest out of pocket payment you will pay is $1000. You will be get into a--anyone that can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in a--in--in the Medicare type option we have, etc. But guess what of the 160 million people who like their healthcare now they can keep it. If they don't like it they can leave, number one.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102000	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two, the fact of the matter is we are in a situation where if you notice he hasn't answered the question. This is about candor, honesty, big ideas.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102001	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Let's have a big idea. The tax of 2 percent that the senator is talking about that raises about $3 billion. Guess what? That leaves you about $28 billion short. The senator said before it's going to cost you in your pay--there will be a deductible in your paycheck. The middle class person someone making $60,000 with three kids they are going to end up paying $5000 more, they are going to end up paying 4 percent more on their income taxes. That's reality. Now that's not a bad idea if you like it. I don't like it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102002	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Sure. That's good.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102003	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So let's be clear I--I have actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company. I have met people who like their doctors--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102004	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	--I have met people who like their nurses, I have met people who like their pharmacist. I have met people who like their physical therapist. What they want is access to health care and we just need to be clear about what Medicare for All is all about. Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage we are going to do this by saying everyone is covered by Medicare for All, every health care provider is covered. And the only question here in terms of differences where to send the bill.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102005	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Let us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as the Canadians or any other major country on earth.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102006	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	This is a America.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102007	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Yeah, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries and they guarantee health care to all people. Under my Medicare for All proposal when you don't pay out-of-pocket and you don't pay premiums may be you run into people who love their premiums. I haven't. What people want is cost-effective health care, Medicare for All will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102008	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I think you know that I don't agree with some of these proposals appear, George. So I'm talking about--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102009	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	If I could--if I could respond to some of the proposals from my friends. First of all Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals. That was a Klobuchar-Sanders Amendment to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada. We have work to bring down the cost by fighting to allow 43 million seniors, that is a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare. I figured that's a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102010	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	But it when it comes to our health care and when it comes to our premiums I go with the doctor's creed which is due no harm and while Bernie wrote the bill I read the bill and on page 8--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102011	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	--on page 8 of the bill it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it and that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance in four years.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102012	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea. And what I favor--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102013	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, and that is a public option, a nonprofit choice that would bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people, and bring down the prices for 13 more million more people. That is a bold idea.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102014	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I'm sorry.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102015	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	STEPHANOPOULOS She said page 8 of the bill, 149 people will lose their health insurance.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102016	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Current health insurance.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102017	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	149 million.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102018	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So let's be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals, doctors won't have to hire people to fill out crazy forms. They won't have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies. People who have sick family members won't have to get into these battles. What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for healthcare for everyone in this country. Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your health care coverage.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102019	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote and that Senator Warren backed--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102020	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	is that it doesn't trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102021	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Not my way or the highway. Now look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with ACA. I propose Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we are right, as progressives that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don't you?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102022	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	George, you talk about was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs, or they go unemployed, or their employer changes their insurance policy. Medicare for all is comprehensive healthcare, covers all basic needs, including home healthcare. It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not. So if you want comprehensive healthcare, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for all is the way to go.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102023	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far. We would not be here if he hadn't the courage, the talent, or the will to see us this far.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102024	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie. You know, you brought us this far in Medicare for all. I support Medicare for all. I always have, but I wanted to make the plan better, which I did, which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them. So under my Medicare for all plan, people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan because that's what people want.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102025	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And I agree we shouldn't take choice from people, but here's the thing. Everybody on this stage, I do believe, is well-intentioned and once that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don't have coverage. But at least five people have talked some repeatedly on the subject and not once have we talked about Donald Trump. So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the affordable care act. We all fought against it and then that late great John McCain at that moment at about 2:00 in the morning killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102026	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Fast-forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump's Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the affordable care act. Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of ban that we placed on denying people who have pre-existing conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans. And frankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they are going to have healthcare and cost will not be a barrier to getting it. But let's focus on the end goal. If we don't get Donald Trump out of office, he's going to get rid of all of it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102027	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Fifteen seconds.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102028	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Fifteen seconds. Look, everybody says you want an option. The option I'm proposing is a Medicare for All and a Medicare for Choice. If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance--from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You don't have--no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered period.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102029	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	And if you notice, nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this large savings. The president thinks--my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer is going to give you back it if you negotiated as union all of these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They are going to give the back that money to the employee?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102030	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Matter of fact, they will under our bill.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102031	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Well, let me tell you something. For socialist, you've got a--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102032	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--For a socialist, you've got a lot more confidence in corporate America that I do.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102033	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Okay.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102034	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	One minute, George.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102035	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	All right, two points.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102036	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Yep.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102037	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	You gotta defend the fact that today not only do we have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you gotta defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they're going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease, cancer or heart disease. Under my legislation, people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer. And our program is the only one that does that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102038	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I know a lot about cancer. Let me tell you something.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102039	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	It's personal to me. Let me tell you something. Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately. And we're talking four, six, eight, 10 years depending on who you talk about before we get to Medicare for All. Come on. I've been there. You've been there. You know what it's like. People need help now, hope now, and do something now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102040	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Yeah.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102041	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Thank you. Listen, I'm grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections of that we have right now. But I also think were being offered a false choice between those who propose an all or nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like that works for them to force them on to Medicare, and others who want to, as the vice president does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions, uninsured and uncared for. In a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, we've got to do better.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102042	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	And my proposal, Medicare for America, says everyone who's uninsured will be enrolled in a Medicare. Everyone who's insufficiently uninsured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare. And of those, like members of unions, who fought for the healthcare plans that work for them and their families are able to keep them up.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102043	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	--That is the best possible path forward.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102044	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--You just described my plan--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102045	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Thank you. And, you know, I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this. And of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barack Obama.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102046	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered. Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn't true when Senator Harris brought that up. There was a--a fact check of that and they said that was true.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102047	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	You know, I grew up with a grandmother who had type II diabetes, and I watched her condition get worse and worse. But that whole time, she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available. If they choose to hold on to strong, solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102048	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. They would have to buy in. That's a big difference, because Barack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102049	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	They do not have to buy in.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102050	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	They do not have to buy in.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102051	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	You just said that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102052	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	No.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102073	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--You're automatically enrolled--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102074	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--That automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his--his health care plan would not automatically enroll you. You would have to opt in. My health care plan would. That's a big difference.

1102075	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	That would be a surprise to him.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102085	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Yeah.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102086	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	But a house divided cannot stand.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102087	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	And that is not how we're going to win this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102088	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Look, everyone, we know we're on the same team. We know we're on the same team. We all have a better vision for healthcare than our current president. And I believe we're talking about this the wrong way.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102089	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	As someone who has run a business, I know that our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. You instead pretend to their contractors. It's hard to change jobs. It's certainly harder to start a business. The pitch we have to make to the American people is we will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102090	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentives so, instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the healthcare system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102091	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	In the Cleveland clinic, where they are paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe, shocker, they prescribe fewer procedures and patient health stays the same or improves.

Look, there are--there are a lot of people watching at home right now listening to us that are afraid because they are in crisis. They don't have health insurance. Their health insurance doesn't go far enough. They can't afford their prescription drugs. Look, I--I'm clear in what I believe. I believe in Medicare for All. I believe it's the best way to rationalize the system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102093	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	But, dear God, I know that every one of my colleagues on the stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions. And I'll tell you, there is an urgency right now in this nation. Everybody feels it. As a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice-	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

They have high blood pressure right now. They have unaffordable insulin right now and this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground but find common ground because we have got one shot to make Donald Trump a one term president--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102095	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--and we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other or demonize and to greet each other. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. If I am the leader, I will work toward the idea of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans. But every single day I will join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

We have to be able to answer this challenge and it is found in our education system where in Texas a five-year-old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended or expelled based on the color of their skin.

1102102	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--or Michael Brown or Pamela Turner's or Walter Scott's or Sandra Bland here from the Houston area. We need to root out racism and I believe that we can do that because that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart. They also need a leader to match that and I will be a president that matches that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102103	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Well, first and foremost I want to hit that point because we know Donald Trump is a racist but there is no red badge of courage were calling him that. Racism exist the question isn't who--who isn't a racist, it is who is and isn't doing something about racism. And this is not just an issue that started yesterday, it is not just an issue that we hear a president that can't condemn white supremacy. We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation from health care to the criminal justice system and it's nice to go all the way back to slavery but dear God we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102104	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--today than all of the slaves in 1850. We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out and having the plan to do something about it. If I am president of the United States we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes and we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans from criminal justice reform to the disparities in healthcare to even one that we don't talk about enough which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice and communities of color all around this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102105	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I think what has deepen divisions in the country is the conduct of this president and we have a chance to change all of that. Look, systemic racism preceded this president and even when we defeat him it will be with us. That is why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it. It--it's not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own. Harms (INAUDIBLE) in the same way that eight dollars saved (INAUDIBLE), so does a dollar stolen and we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts us in two different countries.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102106	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe but this time a Douglas Plan that we invest right here at home to make sure that we are not only dealing with things like the over incarceration of black Americans but also black solutions, entrepreneurship, raising to 25 percent the target for the federal government to do business with minority owned businesses; investing in HBCUs that are training and education the next generation of entrepreneurs.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102107	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We can and must do that but that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced auto worker because when I come--where I come from a lot of times that displaced auto worker is a single black mother of three. We have got to say that I bring people together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102108	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	So there have been--there have been--I am glad you asked me this question and there have been many distortions of my record. Let me be very clear I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons. One, I have always wanted to protect people and keep them safe and second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102109	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had. But I've made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try and do it from the inside. And so I took on the position that allowed me without asking permission to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and become a national model around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs. I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time. I created one of the first in the nation trainings for police officer on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102110	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Was I able to get enough done? Absolutely not. But my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit reasons on day one. It will be--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102111	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	About what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable. And finally, my plan is about making sure that in America's criminal justice system, we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement, and that we work on keeping families intact. And as president of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this done job complete.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102112	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	That's not my record. We are here at eight historically black college and I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan in something that she once said. She said that the people want is simple. They want a country as good as it promise. And that same can be said of the criminal justice system. So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis. But in the prosecutor's office, they were handled with a grand jury. That's how they were all handled across our state.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102113	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself. That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did. 400 people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids. There was a kid named Byron Phillips (SP) that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it. When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups, we put up billboards, we found the shooter, and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a literal girl named Taisha Edwards (SP) who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102114	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	What changes did we make, go after white-collar crime in a big way. Diversify the office in a big way. Work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID. And as a senator and as your president, I will make sure that we don't just do the first step act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the second step act, which means that 90 percent of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let's reduce those sentences for nonviolent offenders and let's get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102115	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Well, first of all, let me say that when I came back from law school, I had a job with great--a big-time law firm and left and became a public defender because my state was under siege. When Doctor King was assassinated, we were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months. I've been involved from the beginning. As a young congressman--as a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in the poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining. Banks should have to lend where they operated, et cetera.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102116	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we are in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime. As--when we are in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation--we build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102117	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	We--I'm the guy that put in the--the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. And so we have to change the whole way we look at this. When we put people in prison, we have to equip them when they get out. Nobody who got in prison for marijuana, for example, immediately upon being released, they shouldn't be in there for a--a Mr.--that should be a misdemeanor. They should be out, and their record should be expunged.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102118	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Every single right should be your term. When you finish your term in prison you should be able to not only vote but have access to Pell Grants, have access to be able to get housing, have access to be able to move along the way.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102119	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I've laid out a detailed plan along those lines. And the fact is we've learned so much more--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102120	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken. There's no difference in America between blacks, whites and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs. But if you're African American you're almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated destroying your lives. And so much of this comes down to privilege. We have a criminal justice system that Brian Stephenson says treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. And so, I have challenged this whole field--we can specifically and demonstratedly now show that there are 17,000 people unjustly incarcerated in America and all of us should come forward and say when we are president of the United States, when I am president of the United States we will release them.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102121	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And let me be specific--I--I joined tighter and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill passed under this president for criminal justice reform that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail. If 87 members of the United States senate says that these sentences are way too long and we changed it, but we didn't make it retroactive we can literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now. Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17,000 people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102122	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And, I challenge you. Don't just say big statements. Back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation--which is liberty and freedom. We need to reform the system and we must do it now. Every day that we wait--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102123	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--is too long.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102124	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Because we got it done before--I'm the only one up here who has ever beat the NRA. Only one that ever beat the NRA nationally. I'm the guy that brought the Brady Bill and the--and the--into focus and became law. And so, that's number one.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102125	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two, after Sandy Hook a number of things happened. This went form a cause to a movement. Look what's happened now--Mothers--the organization, Mothers Against Violence this in--gun violence. We've seen what's happened again. Now, we have all these young people marching on Washington making sure that things are going to change. There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the President had over 50 percent of--of gun--of gun--for members of the NRA supporting them and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102126	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Now, the numbers are much higher because they realize what I've been saying and we've all been saying is correct. Over 90 percent of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street. Period. And we have to get buy backs and get them out of their basements.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102127	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	So, the point is--things have changed and things have changed a lot. And now, what's happening is--and by the way, the way Beto handled--excuse me, for saying Beto, Congressman.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102128	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	It's all right. Beto is good.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102129	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	The way he handled what happened in his hometown is--the look in the eyes of those people to see those kids, to understand those parents--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102130	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--to understand the heartache. We are ready to do this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102131	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Thank you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102132	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	That's right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102133	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Some things you can. Many things you can't.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102134	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I mean I would just say hey, Joe, instead of saying on, we can't let's say yes, we can. (LAUGHTER)	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102135	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Let's be constitutional. Got a constitution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102136	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Yes, we can because I'll tell you something--the way that I think about this is I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102137	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I have attended more police officer funerals than like care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you and the idea that we would wait for this Congress which has just done nothing to act is just it is--it is overlooking the fact that every day in America our babies are going to school to have drills elementary, middle, and high school students where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102138	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I was talking about this at one of my town halls and--and--and this child was eight years old probably came up to me it was like it was a secret between the two of us and he tugged on my jacket and he said I had to have one of those drills. It is traumatizing our children. El Paso and, Beto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102139	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	You know people ask me and El Paso they said because I have a long-standing record on this issue they said well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened. I said well, look, I mean obviously he didn't pull the trigger but he has certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102140	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	What I said was the question speak to constitutional scholars. If in fact we could say by the way you can't own the following weapons, they cannot be sold anymore. Check with constitutional scholars. Now you can say--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102141	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Could I tell you what you could do--respond	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102142	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	I am if it is a weapon that was designed to kill people--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102143	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	--on a battlefield; if they high impact high velocity round when it hits your body shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers. When we see that being used against children and in Odessa I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell yes we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102144	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	We are not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102145	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	I want to say this I am listening to the people of this country the day after I propose doing that I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas to meet with those who are selling AR-15 and AK-47s and those who are buying those weapons. And you might be surprised there was some common ground there. Folks who said I would willing give that up, cut it to pieces I don't need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war. So let's do the right thing but let's bring everyone in America into the conversation Republicans, Democrats, gunowners and non-gunowners alike.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102146	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I so appreciate what the Congressman has been doing and I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. Everyone appear favors an assault weapon ban. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations which by the way would have made a huge difference if that was in place and El Paso in that store were all of those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage and certainly in Dayton, Ohio where in 30 seconds one man guns down innocent people. The cops got there in one minute and it still wasn't enough to save those people. That is what unites us. You know what else unites us and I will tell you this what unites us is that right now on Mitch McConnell's desk are three bills universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don't get AK-47s.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102147	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	So if you want to get something done and I personally think we should start with a voluntary--voluntary buyback program. That is my thing, David. You want to finish this because of you one action now, if you want action now we have got to send a message to Mitch McConnell. We can't wait until one of us gets in the White House. We have to pass those bills right now to get this done because we cannot spare another innocent lie.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102148	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	So background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans. 83 percent of Americans agree with licensing. This is the issue. Look, I grew up in the suburbs. It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner-city Newark, New Jersey and witness the aftermath of a shooting. It's one of the reasons why shooting after shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me. It's why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102149	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And I'm happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing. But this is what I'm sorry about. I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming into my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change. This is a crisis of empathy in our nation. We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action. You want to know how we get this done?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102150	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	We get this done by having a more courageous empathy where people don't wait for this hell to visit upon their communities, they stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. I will lead to change--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102151	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	On this issue because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine because we forget national shootings, these--these mass shootings are tragedies. But the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine. Nobody has ascended to the White House will bring more personal passion on this issue. I will fight this and bring fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102152	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	You know, if--if that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights, if it was this idea that we can't get it done because of the situation in the Senate, I'm looking to lead a movement. The number one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry. Think about this, we have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined from the Revolutionary war till now. This is not a side issue to me. It is a central issue to me. That is the kind of fight because the majority of homicide victims, we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine. We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so that we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby. It is time for a movement on this issue, and I will lead it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102153	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So let's start by framing the problem the right way. We have a gun violence problem in this country. The mass shootings are terrible. But they get all the headlines. Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds. People died from violence from suicide and domestic abuse. We have a gun violence problem in this country. And we agree on many steps we can take to fix it. My view on this is we're going to--it's not going to be one and done on this. We're going to do it, and we're going to have to do it again, and we're going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly. But here's the deal. The question we need to ask is when we've got this much support across the country, 90 percent of Americans want to see us do, I like registration, want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the ground--off the streets, why doesn't it happen? And the answer is corruption, pure and simple.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102154	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry and unless we are willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster, we're not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons. And with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster. Until we attack these systemic problems, we can't get gun reform in this country. We've got to go straight against the industry, and we've got to change Congress, so it doesn't just work for the wealthy and well-connected, so it works for the people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102155	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	No. But what I would support absolutely, is passing major legislation. The gun legislation. The people here are talking about. Medicare for All. Climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen. And you can do it in a variety of ways. You can do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what his appropriate and what is not--what is in order and what is not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102156	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	What I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made that, in fact, in terms of gun issues picking up on Cory and Beto and everybody else--what we are looking at is a corrupt political system and that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what's happening in Washington or in this case, you got an NRA, which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102157	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I am proud. I am proud that year after year I had an F rating from the NRA. And as president I will not be intimidated by the NRA.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102160	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Latinos should look at is comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one. We didn't lock people up in cages, we didn't separate families, we didn't do all of those things. Number one.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102161	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two--number two by the time this is a president that came along with a DACA program. No one had ever done that before. This president sent legislation to the desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America. This is a president who has done a great deal, so I'm proud to have served with him.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102162	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed. I would in fact, make sure that there is we immediately surge to the border all those people are seeking asylum. They deserve to be heard. That's who we are. We are a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression you should come. I would change the order that the president just changed saying women who are being beaten and abused can no longer claim that as a reason for asylum. And by the way, retrospectively--you know, the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up. The Republican congress has not reauthorized it. Let's put pressure to pass the Violence Against Women Act now. Let them go back.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102166	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Jorge, thank you very much for that question and look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants. He builds his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fear mongering and otherising (PH) migrants and that's very different from Barack Obama.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102167	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	But my problem with Vice President Biden and Cory pointed this out last time is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up he says oh, I was there, I was there, I was there--that's me too. And then, every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of he says well, that was the president. I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama's work but not have to answer to any questions.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

I'm not going to pretend like I don't have a--my own vision for immigration. So, we're not going to give up DACA. Were not going to give up protections for anybody. I believe that on January 20th, 2021 we're going to have a Democratic president. Were going to throw out Mitch McConnell--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102180	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our Dreamers but also for their grandparents and for their cousins, for people who's overstayed student visas and for people who came here to work in the fields. I want to have a system that is a path to--to citizenship that is fair and achievable.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102181	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Down at the border, we've got to rework this entirely. A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal, and a 12-year-old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer and it is not serving our values.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102182	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We--we need--I want to add one more part on this, because I think we have to look at all the pieces. Why do we have a crisis at the border? In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102183	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We need to restore that help.

1102190	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	My--my father grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor, and now his son is running for president. That is the immigration story that we have to be able to share--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102191	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	--With the American people. If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants, and rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities. We have to say to the American people immigrants are positive for our economic and social dynamism. And I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama/Biden administration.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102192	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	I think we have to compete for talent. And I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways. He says build a wall. I'm going to say to immigrants come to America because, if you come here, your son or daughter can run for president. The water is great, and this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life. This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations. If we lose that, we lose something integral to our continued success. And that is where I would lead as president.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102196	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform.

Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102197	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	In some of the most conservative rural areas of Iowa I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow and it is why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city. You know the only reason that South Bend is growing right now after years of shrinking is immigration. It is one of the reasons we acted not waiting for Washington to create city issued municipal IDs so that people regardless of immigration status in our city have the opportunity to have the benefits of identification.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102198	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We have an opportunity to actually get something done but we cannot allow this to continue to be the same debate with the same arguments in the same clever lines often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities but our values, values of welcome, values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries their values with our laws.

1102199	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	I do and--and if you read the rest of that article in the Washington Post I talked about harmonizing our entry/exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada. I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa overstates but I think the larger question that we are trying to get it is how do we rewrite this country's immigration laws in our own image, in the image of Houston, Texas, the most diverse city in the United States of America.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102201	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	I will lead an effort to make sure that we rewrite our immigration laws in that way. Never cage another child. Make sure that there is accountability and justice for these seven lives lost under our care and our custody but also face the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike but it to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job that we have been part of the boarding people hundreds of thousands just in the Obama administration alone who pose no threat to this country, breaking up their families, Democrats have to get off the back foot. We have to lead on this issue because we know it is right.

1102202	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	--and extend that to their parents, their sisters and their brothers and ensure that we have a legal, safe, orderly system to come to this country and add to our greatness here.

1102203	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	I will not repeal the tariffs on day one but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal because right now the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102204	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated U.S. intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head. And he said one, how can my workers compete against that and two, think about all of the lost revenue to American companies. So the imbalances are real. We have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides. So no to repealing the tariffs immediately but yes to making sure that we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102205	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Well, the President clearly has no strategy. You know when I first got into this race I remember President Trump scoffed and said he would like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping. I would like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102206	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Is it just me or was that supposed to happen in like April? It is one more example of a commitment not made. When that happens on the international stage people take note, not just our competitors, our adversaries but also our allies take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word or follow through on its plans and when that happens there are serious consequences.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102207	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We saw it at the G7. The leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world, climate change, and there was literally an empty chair where American leadership couldn't have been. The problem is this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever whether it is in Hong Kong where those protesters were democracies need to know that they have a friend in the United States or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around. The world needs America but it can't be just any America it has to--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102208	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage but it's not about the tariffs. Look, what is going on right now is the President who has reduce the entire China challenge into a question of tariffs when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else and there is a lack of a bigger strategy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102209	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	What we've got right now though, George, it is not a focused tariffs on steel. What he has done here he has assessed these tariffs on our allies, he has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips and one of his bankrupt casinos and if we are not careful he is going to bankrupt this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102210	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	One forecast recently says that it is already cost us 300,000 jobs. All right? There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest, in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa. So when I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table. That is what I would do. I wouldn't have put all of these tariffs in place and I wouldn't have had a trade policy where on August 1 he announces he is going to have tariffs on $300 billion of goods, on August 13 he cuts it in half, a week later he says he's going to reduce taxes, the day after that he says he is going to do it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102211	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	The leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength as a nation and yes, we want fair trade but we must work with the rest of the world and he has made a mockery of focused trade policy which I think means enforcement like we have done in northern Minnesota passing bills, getting President Obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit so we are importing--exporting goods and making sure that it is a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things, and exporting to the world. He is defeating that goal.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102212	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Well, look, I agree with those who have said that this erratic, haphazard trade war is hurting American families. As Senator Klobuchar said, 300,000 American jobs, it's estimated that it's cost $600 to the average American family. Just a couple of days ago, 60 percent of Americans said that they believe that we are in for a recession next year. So when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war. We have leverage there. I also believe though that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights. We have millions of Uighurs, for instance, in China that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102213	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And in North Korea, this president is elevating a dictator. We need to stop that. We need to return to ensuring that America leads again on human rights. When it comes to this trade war, I would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down. We have leverage in that discussion.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102214	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades. And it has been broken because it works for giant national corporations and not for much of anyone else. These are giant corporations that, shoot, if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country, they'll do it in a heartbeat. And yet, for decades now, who's been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators? Who has shaped our trade policy? It's been the giant corporations. It's been their lobbies lobbyists and their executives. The way we change our trade policy in America is, first, the procedures, who sits at the table. I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table. I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102215	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I want to negotiate it with environmentalists at the table. I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table. And you asked the question about leverage. If I could just respond to that one, leverage, are you kidding? Everybody wants access to the American market. That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America you want to come so goods to American consumers? Then you've got to raise your standards. You've got to raise your labor standards. You've got to raise your environmental standards. So our companies can compete on a level playing field.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102216	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country. We can use trade to help build a stronger economy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102217	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Well, first of all, I--I have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now, which is that we've got a guy in the White House who has been erratic on trade policy. He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly, born out of his fragile ego. It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soybeans rotting in bins looking at bankruptcy. When we look at this issue, my trade policy under a Harris administration American products is always going to be about saying we need to export, not American jobs. And to do that, we have to have a meaningful trade policy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102218	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I am not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff, and that means you need to sell it to people overseas. That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen. You asked earlier about China. It's a complicated relationship. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property, the dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102219	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea. I am on, and I think the only person on the stage, the Senate intelligence entity and the Senate Homeland security committee. We need a partner on the issue of North Korea. But the bottom line is this. Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that--that guy in the Wizard of Oz, you know, when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude.

1102224	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	So, Trump obviously hasn't a clue. Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at 3:00 in the morning. What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere who are losing billions right now because of Trump's policy, a trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad and then thinks that they're going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102225	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	--They got another guess coming.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102226	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Yeah. Well, look, we are either going to make policy or China's going to make the trade--the rules of the road. We make up 25 percent of the world economy. We need another 25 percent to join us. And I think Eliza--Senator Warren is correct. At the table has to be labor and at the table has to be environmentalists.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102227	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	The fact of the matter is China--the problem is in the trade deficit. The problem is they are stealing our intellectual property. The problem is they're violating the WTO. They're dumping steel on us. That's a different issue than whether or not there dumping agricultural products on us.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102228	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	In addition to that, we're in a position where, if we don't set the rules, we in fact are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And that's why you need to organize the world to take on China to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102229	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Sure. There's a one point we're really missing on the stage right now, which is the fact that Donald Trump's America First policy is actually and America isolated, and America alone policy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102230	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Exactly right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102231	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	From trade to--to battling China to the climate--global crisis of climate change, the challenges in the Middle East, he is pulling us away from our allies; out of the Iran deal, out of the Paris Climate Accords. And on trade, he's deciding to take on China while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102232	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. Now, look, I'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102233	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	But they are not a national security threat. We cannot go up against China alone. This is a president that has a better relationship with the dictators like Duarte and Putin than he does with Merkel and Macron. We are the strongest nation on the planet Earth--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102234	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--And our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose. That's how we be China. That's how we be climate change on the planet Earth. And that's how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers rights.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102235	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Yes. And I'll tell you why. What we're doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States. It is not helping the safety and security of the world. It is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan. We need to bring our troops home.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102236	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	And then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102237	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We're not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan. We need to treat the problem of terrorism is a worldwide problem, and that means we need to be working with all of our allies, our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America. We need to work together to root out terrorism.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102238	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	It means using all of our tools. It means economic investment. It means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the State Department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and tears in many of these countries. We need a foreign policy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102239	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	That is about our security and about leading on our values.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102240	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer--I think it may have been Senator McCain's last trip before he was sick. And, I talked to people--we did--we talked to military leaders American and local leaders. We talked to people on the ground and asked the questions same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee, every time one of the generals comes through--show me what winning looks like--tell me what it looks like. And what you hear is a lot of (INAUDIBLE). Because no one can describe it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102241	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	And, the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military. I have three older brothers who have served in the military--I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made. They will do anything we ask them to do, but we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve. We need to work with the rest of the world. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools. We need to build with our allies and we need to make the whole world safer not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102242	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	You know, I served under General Dunford way under General Dunford, in Afghanistan.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102243	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	And, today, September 12th, 2019 means that today you could be 18 years old--old enough to serve and have not been alive on 9/11. We have got to put an end to endless war. And the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland and that does not require an open ended commitment of ground troops.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102244	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Let me say something else because if there's one thing we've learned about Afghanistan--from Afghanistan it's that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102245	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	And so, when I am president an authorization for a use of military force will have a built in three year sunset. Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to congress to seek an authorization. Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas the least our members of congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there. By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props or worse--tools for his own enrichment.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102246	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We saw what's going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels. I'll tell you--as a military officer the very first thing that goes through your mind, the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you are responsible for in uniform--is do not let these men and women down. This president is doing exactly that. I will not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102247	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	No, it was (INAUDIBLE) wrong to pull out. I want to answer the Afghanistan question. I've been in and out of Afghanistan--not with a gun. And I admire my friend for his service. But I've been in and out of Afghanistan more than anybody on this--on this--and it's an open secret you reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan. The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency meaning that we're going to put that country together. It cannot be put together. Let me--let me say it again--it will not be put together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102248	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	It's three different countries--Pakistan owns the three counties the--the three provinces in the east. They are not any part of it. The economy is running--I can go on and on but here's the point--the point is that it's a counter terrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases and insist that Pakistanis provide bases for us to air--airlift from and to move against what we know. We don't need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford is a fine guy but this has been an internal argument we've had for eight years.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102249	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	With regard to--with regard to Iraq--the fact of the matter is you know, I should have never voted to give Bush the authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the security council to vote 15 to nothing to allow inspectors to go in and determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102250	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	and when that happened he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof. I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on. What I was argued against in the beginning fronts once he started to put the troops in was that in fact we were doing it the wrong way, there was no plan. We should not be engaged. We didn't have the people with us. We didn't have our alliance, we didn't have allies with us, etc. And it was later when we came into office that Iraq turned--the President turned to me and said Joe, when they said we've got a plan to get out he turned to the whole security said simply Joe will organize this, get the troops home. My son spent a year in Iraq and I understand it--and we were right to get the combat troops out.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102251	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	The big mistake that was made which we predicted was that they would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from coming--from moving in. (INAUDIBLE)	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102252	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	David, let me answer that but let me just comment on something that the vice president said. You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge. The truth is the big mistake, the huge mistake in one of the big differences between you and me I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102253	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	You are right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102254	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I voted against the war in Iraq and help lead the opposition and it's sad to say. I mean I kind of had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war. As the former Chairman of the Senate committee on Veterans Affairs I want to pick up on what Pete said. We cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend--defend us, who have responded to the call of duty. But I think also I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of trumps military budgets.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102255	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I don't think we have to spend $750 billion a year on the military when we don't even know who our enemy is.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102256	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together, bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism and make it clear that we as a planet, as a global community, will work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism by dropping bombs on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102257	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	I signed a pledge to in the forever wars. We have been in a state of continuous armed conflict for 18 years which is not what the American people want.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102258	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	We have to start owning what we can and can't do. We are not very good at rebuilding countries and if you want proof all you have to do is look within our own country at Puerto Rico. We have spent trillions of dollars to unclear benefits, lost thousands of lives and thank you Pete for your service and the goal has to be to rebuild the relationships that have made America strong for decades. I would lead our Armed Forces with the restraint and judgment. With the American people one is simply a President who has the right values and point of view and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harm's way and that is what I would do as President	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102259	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Well, first of all let me be very clear anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant. What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make and can create their own future.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102260	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	In terms of democratic socialism to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe is extremely unfair.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102261	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	--Tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism. I agree with what goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102262	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102263	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage and that we expand the trade union movement.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102264	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I happen to believe also that what, to me, democratic socialism means is we deal with an issue, we do not discuss in a foyer, not in the media, and not in Congress. You've got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country. You've got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies, and in the media. Maybe, just me and maybe, what we should be doing is creating an economy that works for all of us, not 1 percent. That's my understanding of democratic socialism.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102265	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Sure. Thank you, Jorge. I'll call Maduro a dictator because he is a dictator.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102266	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And while we need to do is to, along with our allies, make sure that the Venezuelan people get the assistance that they need, that we continue to pressure Venezuela so that they'll have free and fair elections, and also here in the United States, offer temporary protected status, TPS to Venezuelans.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102267	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do. For all have his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan American community, he has failed. I will not. I also believe that we need to do things like a 21st century Marshall plan for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala so that people can find safety--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102268	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States. And, under my administration, we're going to put renewed focus on Latin America. It makes sense. They are our neighbors and we have a lot of things in common. It also makes sense that--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102269	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--That because we have a country like China that is going around the world to places like Africa and Latin America making their own relationships, strengthening those, United States needs to strengthen its partnerships in Latin America immediately. And I will.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102270	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	You know, first of all, I want to say no. Actually, I want to translate that into Spanish. No.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102271	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Look, on--let's just be clear, the factory farming going on that's assaulting this corporate consolidation, the agriculture industry, one of the reasons why I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment. You see independent family farmers being pushed out a business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that don't line up with our values. That's what I'm calling for.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102272	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	But I want to--I want to switch because we don't have a crowded debate stage, we were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq, it--it annoys me that we have a conversation about our troops overseas and we didn't say one word about veterans in our country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102273	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	We have a shameful reality in America that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds, hurts, and harms. They are disproportionately homeless. You hear stories about women waiting for months or gynecological care through the VA. It is very important that as we as a country understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us. We end our national anthem home of the brave. It's about time we make this a better home for our bravest.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102274	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Yes, we will follow through regardless of the political consequences or who it offends because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it. We will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050, that we are halfway there by 2030, that we mobilize $5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that, that we invest here in Houston, Texas with pre-disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding. Given the fact that this town has seen three 500 year floods--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102275	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	In just five years, you'd like to think you're good for 1500 years, but you're not. They're coming faster and larger and more devastating than ever. We are also going to make sure that we free ourselves from dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology, as well as the high-paying, high skill, high wage jobs that come along with that. And then we're going to pay farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102276	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Cover crops, keeping more land under conservation. Using no till farming, regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil. That's the way that were going to meet this challenge and we're going to bring everyone into the solution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102277	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Thank you. This is the existential crisis of our time. It's--you know that movie the Day After Tomorrow? It's today. We have seen a warming in our world like never before. We are seeing flooding in the Midwest, flooding in Houston fires in the West.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102278	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	And I think having someone leading the ticket from the Midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done. On day one, I will get us back into the International Climate Change Agreement.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102279	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	On day two, I will bring back the clean power rules that President Obama had worked on. And on day three, I will bring back the gas mileage standards. You can do all that without Congress, which is good. On day four, five, and six, I will, working with Congress and mayors and businesspeople all over the country, introduced sweeping legislation to get at that 2050--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102280	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	--Goal. And on day seven you're supposed to rest, but I won't.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102281	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	This is what we need to do if we're going to get at climate change. We have to take this on as a crisis that's happening right now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102282	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Yes. We need to work on every front on climate change. It is the threat to every living thing on this planet and we are running out of time. Every time the scientists go back, they say we have less and less time than we thought we had. But that means we got to use all the tools.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102283	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools. I have proposed, following Governor Inslee, that we by 2028 cut all carbon emissions from new buildings, by 2030 carbon emissions from cars, and by 2035 all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity. That alone, those three, will cut our emissions here in the United States by 70 percent. We can do this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102284	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We also need to help around the world to clean, but understand this one more time. Why doesn't it happen?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102285	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future, we can make the changes we need to make. We have to attack corruption head on so that we can save our planet.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102286	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	When I think about this issue, it really is through the lens of my baby nieces, who are one and a half and three years old. When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing when they turn 20, I am really scared. And when I've been in the United States Senate for now the last two and half years and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children. And then when they look at the mirror, I don't know what they see, but it's a lack of courage.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102287	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And these--this is an issue that, yes, it represents an existential threat. It is also something we can do something about. And this is a problem that was created by human behaviors, and we can change our behaviors in a way that saves our planet. I've seen it happen.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102288	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	In California, I took on--as the Attorney General of California, I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. I took on the big oil companies and we saw progress. If any of you have been to Los Angeles--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102289	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--Twenty years ago, you'll remember that sky was brown. You go there now, the sky is blue. And you know why? Because leaders decided to lead, and we took on these big fossil fuel companies. We have some of the most important and strongest laws--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102290	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--In the country, and we made a difference. And my point being I've done it before and I will lead as president on this issue because we have no time. The clock is tipping--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102291	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--Ticking, but--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102292	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--We need courage and we need courageous leadership. We can get this done.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102293	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	So to follow up on what Elizabeth said, why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102294	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	--Yeah--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102295	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	--Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA? And the answer is this. We all know, everyone on this stage knows, that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests. Now, everyone here has a plan to try and curb those corporate interests, but we have to face facts.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102296	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Money finds a way. The money will find its way back in. So, what is the answer? The answer is to wash the money out with a people powered money.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102297	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	My proposal is that we give every American 100 democracy dollars that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like. This would wash out the lobbyist cash by a factor of eight to one. That is the only way we will win. And as someone running for president, I'll tell you there is the people on one side and the money on the other. The only way for us to win is if we bring them together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102298	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Let me be clear, I am pro-good school. I've got a kid one of my little boys just started public school last weekend I was not there because I was running for president.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102299	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	So we need to pay teachers more because the data clearly shows that a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102300	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized test which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human worth.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102301	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	But here is the big one, the data clearly shows that 65 percent to 70 percent of our students outcomes are determined outside of the school. We are talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they are young, stress levels in the house, income, type of neighborhood. We are putting money into schools and educators know this, we are saying you are 100 percent responsible for educating our kids but you can only control 30 percent. They all know this, the answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn and our teachers the chance to teach.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102302	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Step one is a point a Secretary of Education new actually believes in public education.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102303	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I believe in public education and in order to strengthen it some things are very complex for preparing for a future where knowledge is that at your fingertips but we have got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning. Some of it is extremely simple, we have just got to pay teachers more. And we have got to lift up the teaching profession.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102304	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I always think of a story from South Bend of friends who host exchange students from Japan. They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher and they kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college. She took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well and she came up just short. So you know what she did since she was academically good but couldn't quite make the cut to be a teacher? She had a fallback--fallback plan, she became a doctor. That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102305	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	If we want to get the results that we expect for our children we have to support and compensate the teaching profession respected teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102306	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	You know, I think I'm the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102307	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in second grade. And let's be clear in all of the ways we talk about this money for public schools should stay in public schools not go anywhere else.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102308	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I have already made my commitment. I will--we will have a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102309	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I think this is ultimately about our values. I have proposed a two cent wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1 percent in this country. That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal childcare for every baby age 0 to 5, universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in this country--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102310	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	--raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country, cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who have got it--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102311	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	And strengthen our unions. This is how we build an America that reflects our values not just where the money comes from with the billionaires and corporate executives.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102312	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	My first grade teacher Mrs. Francis Wilson, God rest her soul attended my law school graduation. I think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us. I have offered in this campaign a proposal to deal with this which will be the first in the nation federal investment in closing the teacher pay gap which is $13,500 a year because right now in our public schools are teachers 94 percent of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102313	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And that is wrong. I also want to talk about where we are here at TS you and what it means in terms of HBCUs. I have as part of my proposal that we will put $2 trillion into investing in our HBCUs for teachers--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102314	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--because--because--because one, as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102315	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	-- I will say--I will say that it is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these many professions but also--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102316	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	But this is a critical point	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102317	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	If a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade they are 13 percent more likely to go to college.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102318	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	If that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade they are 32 percent more likely to go to college. So, when we talk about investing in our public education system it is at the source of so much when we fix it that will fix so many other things. We must invest in the (INAUDIBLE).	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102319	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And I strongly believe you can judge a society based on how it treats its children and we are (INAUDIBLE) on this issue.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102320	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Guess what?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102321	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	You're guessing, all right--now, here's the answer--we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world and yet we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on earth. We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they can't work two or three jobs to support themselves.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102322	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	That's right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102323	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Which is why under my legislation we will move to see that every teacher in America makes at least $60,000 a year.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102324	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	What we will also do is not only have universal pre-K we will make public colleges and universities and HBCUs debt free.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102325	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	And what we will also do because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need--we are going to cancel all student debt in this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102326	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	We are going to do that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102327	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Well, they have to deal with the--look--there is institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved I started dealing with that--redlining, banks, making sure that we are in a position where look--you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools the Title 1 schools--triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to 45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise an equal raise of getting out the $60,000 level.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102328	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two, make sure we bring in the help (INAUDIBLE) the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home we need--we have one school psychologist for every 1500 kids in America today. It's crazy. The teachers are (INAUDIBLE) I'm married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have to make sure that every single child does, in fact, have three, four and five year olds go to school. School. Not daycare. School. We bring social workers into homes of parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102329	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	It's not that they don't want help. They don't know quite what to do. Play the radio. Make sure the television--excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night the--the phone. Make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school--a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there. There is so much we can--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102330	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	No, I'm going to go like the rest of them do--twice over. Ok?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102331	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Because here's the deal--the deal is that we've got this little backwards. And by the way, in Venezuela we should be allowing people to come here form Venezuela. I know Maduro, I've confronted Maduro. Number two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America--I'm the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries in fact, change their system so people don't have a chance. You all are acting like we just discovered this yesterday.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102332	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Thank you very much--well that's--that's quite a lot. But--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102333	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	You know, I grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about in a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation. In fact, in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case challenging how Texas financed its schools. And, I know that today, our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102334	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102335	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Now, I have an education plan like a lot of folks up here that would pay teachers more, that would recruit diverse ranks of teachers, that would invest in our public schools. But I also believe that we have to connect the dots to uplift the quality of life--to invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED and healthcare opportunities. And those things that truly, truly ensure that the entire family can prosper.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102336	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Those are the types of things that we need to do in addition to lifting up our public schools. You asked a second ago about charter schools. Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools. They're not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102337	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And so--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102338	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--While I'm not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them that is required right now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102339	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	So, I'm--I'm hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that--and the way we talk about communities of color. Look, I--I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line. I lived in public housing projects almost for a decade and saw the anguish of the parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don't have a school that serves their genius.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102340	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	I think I'm the only person on the stage, even though I had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system, I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools and we produced results. A lot of folks here talking about raising teacher's salary. We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102341	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And we didn't stop there. Yeah, we closed for performing charter schools but, dagnabbit, we expanded high-performing charter schools. We were a city that said we need to find local solutions that worked for our community. The results speak for themselves. We are now the number one city in America for a beat the odds of the schools, from high poverty to high-performance.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102342	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Strategies like investing in our children work. And I'll tell you this. I--I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from other issues. That's why my friend, Secretary Castro, is 100 percent right. We are in the reality we are right now because, vice president, of overtly racist policies not 400 years ago, just in my lifetime, that we are redlining communities, dis-investing in communities. And more than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation in housing and--and the challenges of underfunded schools, but they're also struggling with environmental injustice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102343	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	If you talk to someone who's a parent of a child who's had permanent brain damage because of lead, you'll know this is a national problem, because there's over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102344	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And so, if I'm president of the United States, it is a holistic solution to education from raising teacher's salary, fully funded special education, but combating the issues of poverty, combating the issues of racial segregation, combating the issues of a criminal justice system--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102345	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--That takes parents away from their kids, and dealing with environmental justice as a major pillar of any climate policy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102346	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I--I never count any professional setback I have as a serious setback. There's things that are important, things that are unimportant.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102347	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102348	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--I'm sorry.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102349	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	There's setbacks and there's setbacks. And I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose--well, my dad had an expression. He said Joe, it's not a question of succeeding whether you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. And--and he he'd say--he'd you never explain and never complain. And then he'd go on to say that the only obligation that really matters, the most important thing is family. It's why I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything, family. And you could be judged on how you treat your family and how you went from there.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102350	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	And I--it took--you know, Kierkegaard said faith sees best in the dark. Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automatic automobile accident and my--and my two sons were badly injured and I'd just been elected, not sworn in. And I lost my faith for a while. I came back. And then later, when my send son Bo (SP) came from home from Iraq and with a terminal disease and a year later--a year and half later losing him was like losing part of my soul. But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose. Purpose and what you do.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102351	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	And that's why I hope--I hope he's proud of me today because he wanted to make sure I'd didn't run for president but I stayed engaged because when you get hit badly, whether you're losing a job or you're raising a family my dad where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid you can't live here anymore, dad lost his job, you know, we--we've all been through that in some form or another. But it just takes--it just, for me, the way I've dealt with it is finding purpose. And my purpose is to do what I've always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy and--but there's a lot of people who been through a lot worse than I have, get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another without the help I had. They are real heroes out there. Real heroes.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102352	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I'm mentioned earlier I've known what I wanted to be since second grade. I wanted to be a public school teacher. And I invested early. I used to line my dollies up and teach school. I had a reputation for being tough but fair.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102353	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn't have money for to send me off to four years at the University. And my story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. I got a scholarship college application, much less and then, at 19, got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over. I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston and I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies look like. I had four--I had four to six-year-olds.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102354	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back of the day, that meant that the principal said to me--wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. So there I am. I'm at home, I've got a baby, I can't have a job. What am I going to do? Here's resilience. I said I'll go to law school. And the consequence was I practice law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love, which is teaching. But let me get into fights, it gave me new tools. And the reason I'm standing here today is because I got back up, I fought back. I know what's broken. I want to be in the fight to fix it in America.

1102356	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Resilience to me means growing up in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. Professional resilience means to me, George, running for U.S. Senate in Vermont and getting 1 percent of the vote, running for governor and getting 2 percent of the vote, finally becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont, with 10 vote margin. What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country. Whether it is Wall Street--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102357	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	--whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex. And I feel confident that given a lifelong record of taking on powerful special interest, of standing up for the working families of this country that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that work for all of us not just the 1 percent.

1102358	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	You know, every office I have run for whether it be district attorney or attorney general I was told each time it can be done. They said nobody like you has done it before, you are--nobody is ready for you. When I ran for DA I want and became the first black woman elected DA in a state of 40 million people in San Francisco. When I ran for Atty. Gen. of California I was elected because I didn't listen and I was the only black elected woman black elected attorney general in the state--in the country. And each time people would say it's not your time, it's not your turn, it's going to be too difficult, they are not ready for you and I didn't listen and a part of it probably comes from the fact that I was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me including don't you ever let anybody tell you who you are, you tell them who you are.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102359	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And when I look around the town halls that we do in this race for President of the United States and I look at the--the meetings that we do and the community meetings and I see these little girls and boys sometimes even brought by their fathers and they bring them to me and I talk to them during these events and they smile and they are full of joy and their fathers tell them see don't you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be you have to believe what can be unburdened by what has been.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102360	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	You know as a military officer serving under don't ask don't tell and as an elected official in the state of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor at a certain point when it came to professionals setbacks I had to wonder whether just acknowledging who I was was going to be the ultimate career ending professional setback.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102361	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I came back from the deployment and realize that you only get to live one life and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer so I just came out. I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially conservative community. What happened was when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them they decided to trust me and reelected me with 80 percent of the vote and what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what is worth more to you than winning. And I think that is what we need in the presidency right now. We have to know what we are about in this election is not about any of us up here, it is not about this president even though it is hard to talk of anything else some days. It is about the people who trust us with their lives. The kid wondering if we are actually going to make their schools safe when they have learned active shooter drills before they have learned to read; a generation wondering whether we will actually get the job done on climate change	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102362	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	XXX on climate change	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102363	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	I was an unhappy lawyer for five full months and I left to start a business. And I'm going to share with you all one of the secrets entrepreneurship. If you want to start something, tell everyone you know you're going to do it, and then you don't have a choice. You put your heart and soul into it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102364	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	And even though I did that, my company flopped, had it's a mini rise and maximum fall. I lost investors, hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed 100,000 in school debt. My parents still told people I was a lawyer. I guess it was a little easier.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102365	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	So, I remember lying--lying on my floor looking up, wondering how it had come to this. Eventually, I picked myself back up. I kept working in small growth companies for another 10 years, and eventually had some success.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102366	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Then after I did have some success, I still remember how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you. And so, I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that help train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Nguyen (PH), who's here in the audience tonight, who left--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102367	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	--Who left his gilded Wall Street job to be--to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio. Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102368	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	But the goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102369	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	so, I--my biggest professional setback is--is embarrassing because a lot of folks know about it. I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey in 2002 took on the political machine. And boy, did they fight back. I had tires on my car slashed. Our campaign offices were broken into. My phones were tapped. It became a spectacle and we lost that election.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102370	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And here's a bit of advice to everybody. If you're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102371	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--An Oscar-nominated documentary called Street Fight. But then, unfortunately, another setback. It lost in the Oscars to a movie called March of the dagnabbed Penguins, for crying out loud.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102372	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	The people in my community, was living in the projects, told me don't give up on the people and the people won't give up on you. Create bigger and bolder coalitions and you're going to win. And you know what? We came back four years later and one of the largest lopsided victory in our city's history. But more than that, the lesson was there.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102373	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	We didn't give up. We were taking on America's toughest problems from crime to poverty, and we transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system. There's more work to do, but I haven't given up on the people. I still live in that community.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102374	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	But this is the big lesson. My staff and that my friends and my community told me, if you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor's race, but that's not what life is about. There is an old African saying that says if you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102375	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people, because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power. And the test of America right now, it's not a referendum on Donald Trump. It's a referendum on us and who we are and who we are going to be together. We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose. And then there's nothing we can't do together as a nation.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102376	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Thank you, George. Everything that I've learned about resilience I've learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas. In the face of this act of--of terror that was directed at our community in large part by the president of the United States that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that nor were we defined by that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102377	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us to set the example for the rest of this country. We don't see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous. We see them as foundational to our success, to our strength, and to our security into our safety.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102378	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Yesterday I was visiting with one of those victims. He's the head coach of the Fusion. This is a girls soccer team of 10 and 11-year-old girls. His name is Luis. He was shot in the legs multiple times. He was shot in the side multiple times. He's still healing from his wounds in the hospital. But from his hospital bed, he still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team. Nimmo (PH) his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital. Those two men, Jessica (PH) and Marcella (PH), their wives, they exemplify resilience to me.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102379	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	And when we in this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we're defined not by our fears but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102380	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	My challenges and resilience have brought me up here. I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life and after his third DWI he had a choice between jail and treatment. He chose treatment with his faith, with his friends, with our family and his words he was pursued by grace. And that made me interested in public service because I feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102381	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I then, got married. My husband is out there somewhere hopefully smiling. And our daughter--and our daughter was born I had this expectation we are going to have this perfect birth and she was really sick. And she couldn't swallow. And she was in and out of hospitals for a year and a half. But when she was born they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours. She was in intensive care and I was kicked out. And I thought, this could never happen to any other mom again. So, I went to the legislature, our state legislator not an elected official--a mom and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48 hour hospital stay.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102382	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	And, when they tried to delay the implementation of that law I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyists two to one. And when they said, want you to take place they all raised their hand and said no. That is what motivated me to go into public service. And when I got to that gridlock of Washington D.C. and got to work and pass over 100 bills and I know a lot of my friends form the left--but remember I am from the middle of the country. And I believe that if we're going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit. Someone who is not just going to change the policies but change the tone in the country. And someone who believes in America and believes it from the heart because of where they came from. That everyone should have that same opportunity.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102383	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	In many ways, I shouldn't be here on this stage, you know, Castro is my mother's name and was my grandmother's name before her. I grew up in a single parent household on the west side of San Antonio, going to the public schools eventually my brother Joaquin and I became the first in our family to become professionals.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102384	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And, when I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town. I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000. A few months later I got elected to the San Antonio City Council and the City Council at the time was only pay $1040 a year. So, everybody had another job and my job was at the law firm.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102385	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Well, a few months after I got elected the law firm got a client. And the client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didn't think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I want dot vote against it. And my constituents wanted me to vote against it. But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas, cause believe it or not lawyers have ethics rules. You can't just go against the interest of a client.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102386	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	So, I was stuck. On the one hand I wanted to do the right thing. On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment depended on me shutting up--being conflicted out. So, one day I walked into my law firm and I quit my job. And then, I went and I voted against that land deal on the city council.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102387	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And, you know, it was the first test that I had and I think back to that because often times we think of politics and you think of politics as dirty or corrupting. I wondered before I went in whether it would change who I was. And I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent and not for big special interests. There is nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the president of the United States.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102388	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	This president has failed that test. But I want you to know that if you elect me president I won't. I won't serve anybody except you and your family. And together, we can create an America that's better than ever. Thank you very much.
