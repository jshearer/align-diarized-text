470068	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	To the working people of America tonight I bring you a message of hope. We can make change in this country, I know from personal experience it can be done. When I became the mayor of the nation's largest city, I set us on a path of bold change. They said it couldn't be done, but we gave pre-K to every child for free. We got rid of stop and frisk, and we lowered crime. We raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Yes, it can be done.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470069	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Now tonight we have to get to the heart and soul of who we are as Democrats. There are good people on this stage, but there are real differences.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470070	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Joe Biden told wealthy donors that nothing fundamentally would change if he were president. Kamala Harris said she's not trying to restructure society. Well, I am. For 40 years working people have taken it on the chin in this country. For 40 years the rich have gotten richer, and they have paid less and less in taxes. It cannot go on this way.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470071	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	When I am president we will even up the score, and we will tax the hell out of the wealthy to make this a fairer country and to make sure it's a country that puts working people first.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470072	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	I love our country. It's why I enlisted after 9/11. I have served as a soldier for over 16 years, deployed twice to the Middle East, and serve in Congress now for almost 7 years. I know what patriotism is and I've known many great patriots throughout my life. And let me tell you this, Donald Trump is not behaving like a patriot. As president, I will bring the spirit of real patriotism to the White House, serving the interests of all Americans, not just the rich and powerful. I'll fight for our rights and freedoms of all Americans, upholding these principles in our Constitution upon which our country was founded. Fighting for justice and equality for all, fighting for every single American, regardless of race or religion as we strive towards that a more perfect union. As president, I will bring this unifying spirit of love for country and the soldiers' values of service above self to the White House, truly leading a government of, by, and for the people.

470073	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Thank you, Dana, and good evening. You know, just a few days ago, we were reminded and inspired by our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico that public service is not fundamentally about any of us, it's about you and your family. I want you to know that if I am elected president, that I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can have good healthcare when you need it so that your children and grandchildren can get a good education so that they can reach their dreams, and that you could have good job opportunities whether you live here in a big city like Detroit or in a small town in our country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470074	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	I know we have a wonderful special nation, but that too many people are struggling. And I know what that's like too. You know, I grew up with a single mom in a poor neighborhood. But like many of you, I don't want to make America anything again. I don't want us to go backward. We're not going back to the past. We're not going back where we came from, were going to move forward. We're going to make America better than it's ever been in the years to come. Let's do that together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470075	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	If you've heard anything about me in my campaign, you've heard that someone is running for president who wants to give every American $1,000 a month. I know this may sound like a gimmick, but this is a deeply American idea from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King to today. Let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it. Why do we need to do it? We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next. If you don't believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470076	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	How do we pay for it? Raise your hand in the crowd if you've seen stores closing where you live. It is not just you. Amazon is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing. We need to do the opposite of much of what we are doing right now, and the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470077	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	So let me share the math. $1000 a month for every adult would be $461 million every month right here in Detroit alone. The automation of our jobs is a central challenge facing us today. It is why Donald Trump is our president and any politician not addressing it is failing the American people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470078	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Thank you, Dana. Last week, the president of the United States attacked an American city calling it a disgusting rat-infested rodent mess. We need a nation that understands these tired old language the--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470079	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Donald Trump from Baltimore to even the border is using the tired old language of demigods, of fear mongers, of racists to try to divide our country against itself. We know who Donald Trump is. But in this election the question is--who are we as a people? We have serious problems in America. We have deep wounds and seriously deeply rooted challenges. We desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward. Because we know in this country that our fates are united. That we have a common destiny. The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose. That's how we will beat Donald Trump. That's how I will beat Donald Trump. And as your president, that's how I will govern and move us forward together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470080	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	This is an inflection moment in the history of our country. I think we all know that. This is a moment in time that is requiring us each as individuals and collectively to look in a mirror and ask a question. That question being, who are we? And I think most of us know that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this. So, this then becomes a moment that we must fight for the best of who we are and fight of course, we will. And this is not a new fight for us as Americans. We have always been prepared to fight for our ideas. We have always been a nation that fights for the best of who we are. And I tell you, I come from fighters. My parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement. My sister Maya and I joke, we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults, which meant full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice. And I am prepared to march with you, to fight with you to be the best of who we are and to successfully prosecute the case of four more years of Donald Trump and against him.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470081	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Tonight, I think democrats are expecting some engagement and I expect we'll get it. I'm running for president to restore the soul in our country. We have a president that everyone has acknowledged here, every day is ripping at the social fabric of our country. No one man has the capacity to rip that apart. It's too strong. We're too good. Just look at this stage made up of very diverse people from diverse backgrounds went on to be mayors, senators, congressman, members of the cabinet and yes, even the vice president. Mr. President, this is America. And we are strong and great because of this diversity, Mr. President.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470082	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Not--not in spite of it, Mr. President. Mr. President let's get something straight. We love it. We are not leaving it. We are hear to stay and we are certainly not going to leave it to you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470083	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Well, they're probably confused because they haven't read it. But the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families, listening to experts, listening to healthcare providers and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people. Responsive to their needs of understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long. That American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and--and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy. I listen to the American families that say four years is not enough to transition into this new plan so I devised a plan where it is going to be 10 years of a transition --	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470084	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I listened to American families who said I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So, I designed a plan where, yes, responsive to the needs of American families. There will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare because the bottom line is this, we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And in America today, far too many people--in fact, 30 million people--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470085	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--are going without access to healthcare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470086	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Well, my response is that the senator's had several plans so far and any time someone tells you you're going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years. If you notice, there's no talk about the fact that the plan, in 10 years, will cost $3 trillion. You will lose your employer-based insurance. And in fact, you know, this is the single most important issue facing the public. And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can't beat President Trump with double talk on this plan.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470087	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Absolutely. Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing. The reality is that our plan will bring healthcare to all Americans under a Medicare for All system. Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day. Babies will be born into our plan. And right now, 4 million babies almost are born every day in America--or every year in America. Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470088	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Your plan, by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans. So, I think that you should really think about what you're saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to healthcare and do not want cost to be their barrier to getting it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470089	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	The plan, no matter how you cut it, costs $3 trillion when it is, in fact, employed, number one. Ten years from now, after two terms of the senator being president. After her time. Secondly, it will require middle class taxes to go up, not down. Thirdly, it will eliminate employer-based insurance. And fourthly, what happens in the meantime?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470090	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I'd like to respond. First of all, the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive. Second, we are now paying $3 bill--trillion a year for healthcare in America. Over the next 10 years, it's probably going to be $6 trillion. We must act. My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage. Right now, in America, we have seniors who every day--millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need. All people should have access to healthcare and--and cost should not be their barrier.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470091	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Thank you. I don't know what the vice president and senator are talking about. The folks I talk to about health insurance say that their health insurance isn't working for them. There's tens of millions of Americans don't even have health insurance. Tens of millions more--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470092	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	--who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the copays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses. There's this mythology that somehow all these folks are in love with their insurance in America. What I hear from union members and from hard working middle class people is they wish they had better insurance. And they're angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage, like mental health care--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470093	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	--dental care, the things that would be full coverage--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470094	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	--for all Americans.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470095	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	My response is Obamacare is working. The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare. Go back and do--take aw--take back all the things that Trump took away, provide a public option, meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into the option. If they didn't they like their employer plan or if they're on Medicaid, they'd automatically in the plan. It would be--take place immediately. It would move quickly and it would insure the vast, vast, vast majority of Americans.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470096	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	In the mean time, what happens? Did anybody tell you how much their plans cost? My plans cost $750 billion. That's what it cost. Not $30 trillion.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470097	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	In response to Senator Biden about the Affordable Care Act it is important that you understand that our Medicare for all plan has actually by the architect of the Obama Affordable Care Act been described as one of the most effective ways to bring health care to all, Kathleen Sebelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470098	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	In terms of the point that--that Senator Gillibrand is raising I couldn't agree more. Senator Biden, your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with the status quo doing business as usual and that is going to be about jacking up co-pays, jacking up deductibles - Max	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470099	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	It will still be the situation--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470100	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--that people going to an emergency room have to come out $5000.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470101	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	My plan makes the limit of co-pay to be $1000 because we further support the--the--the ability to buy into the Obama care plan. Secondly, the idea that this is somehow a bad idea, no one has to keep their private insurance, but if they like their insurance, they should be able to keep it. Nothing is demanding in my plan that there be private insurance. It says if the 160 million people who have it say they like their employer insurance they should have a right to have it. If they don't they can buy into the Biden plan which is Obama care--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470102	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Well, first of all, let me just say that the person that's enjoying this debate the most right now is Donald Trump as we pit Democrats against each other while he is working right now--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470103	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	--to take away America's healthcare. There is a court case working through the system that is going to get the Affordable Care Act and actually got protections on pre-existing conditions. And so I was raised by two civil rights parents who told me always keep your eyes on the prize and that is that in the United States of America every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to health care, that it is a human right and how we get there it has to be to end this broken system because we are on our way in just a handful of years of literally spending 20 percent of our economy, one out of every five dollars spent on healthcare and we spend more than every other nation on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs, multiple more than other country--multiple more than other countries.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470104	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	And so you want to know what I'm going to do, I'm going to work to get as to a point where Medicare for all where everyone is covered but this pitting against progressives and against moderates saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn't care enough that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in face of the real enemy here.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470105	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	And I am going to keep fighting for that end.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470106	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	The reality is right now; we don't have a health care system. We have a sick care system, and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it. So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies who have been profiting off the backs of sick people have a seat at the table writing this legislation.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470107	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	Now Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sebelius who helped write her bill. This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal. Kathleen Sebelius works for Medicare advantage, private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan. If we are seeking to really reform our healthcare system, we've got to shut out big insurance and big Pharma out of the drafting process so they cannot continue to profit off of the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470108	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Well, unfortunately, representative Gabbard got it wrong. Kathleen (INAUDIBLE) did not write my plan, she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyone is going to have access to health care in America and when we talk about this again I--I am going to go back to Vice President Biden because your plan does not cover everyone in America by your staffs and your own definition 10 million people, as many as 10 million people will not have access to health care and in 2019 in America for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone I think is without excuse. Our plan covers everyone--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470109	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--and gives people choice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470110	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	--Does cover--will cover everyone. Number one. Number two, the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling and drug prices. The bio pharma is now where things are going to go. It's no longer chemicals. It's about all these breakthroughs we've had with the dealing with the whole, excuse me, immune system. And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in the HHS and says as you develop a drug, you've got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for. We will set the price. And secondly, it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on and the--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470111	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I--I would like to respond.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470112	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Well, I know that this is something very personal for all Americans. You know, I grew up with that grandmother that hide diabetes and I watched as her condition got worse and worse. That whole time she had to Medicare. I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it and then expand it to anybody who wants it. I also believe though that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong that they want to hold on to that they should be able to do that. What I don't believe is that the profit motive of big Pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine in our great nation whether somebody gets healthcare or not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470113	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	Well, first of all, with all due respect to my friend, Michael Bennett, my plan is--does not offer anything that is illegal. What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare, meaning that where you work will not be--the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work. I have met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like where they are not prospering simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides. It's time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get. And under my plan, we do that. As it relates to the insurance and the pharmaceutical companies--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470114	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--Who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by Senator Biden--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470115	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--Or Senator Bennet's plan--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470116	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--We will do that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470117	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	He--we cannot keep with the Republican talking points on this. You've got to stop. The reality is that what--under my Medicare for all plan, yes, employers not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get. They will be able to make that decision. Private insurance companies and private carriers, if they comply by our rules and play by our rules, will be able to offer those employees health care coverage under your private Medicare plan or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan. But is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only. They want choice and my plan gives that to them.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470118	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	I just want to share a story. When I told my wife I was running for president you know, the first question she asked me? What are we going to do about our healthcare? That's a true story and it's not just us. Democrats are talking about our healthcare in the wrong way. As someone who has run a business I can tell you flat out our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire, it makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees, it makes it harder to switch jobs as Senator Harris just said and it is certainly a lot harder to start a business. If we say look, we are going to get healthcare off the backs of businesses and families then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom. That's the argument we should be making to the American people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470119	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	I don't understand why democrats on this stage are fear mongering about universal healthcare. It makes no sense. Ask the American people--they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them. Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies. They feel they are holding back their families because they can't get the coverage they need. They get a lot of nos. They don't get a lot of health from health insurance companies.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470120	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold? That says, we don't need to be dependent on private insurance. We can have a system that actually covers everyone. You know what? Donald Trump won this state of Michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo. How about we be the party that's going to disrupt the status quo for working people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470121	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Certainly, with all due respect to Senator Bennet, what he is saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes. Americans right now are paying so much money for their healthcare. Ask people about the reality of their premiums, deductibles, copays, out of pocket expenses--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470122	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	--that's worse than any tax.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470123	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	People are paying that right now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470124	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Senator, if we as democrats say we are done with private insurance that has only hurt he American people in so many ways we are going to give something that works t=for their families full coverage that they can depend on. If we say that then there is an election. The American people get to decide. The ultimate choice, Senator, is an election. And this should be the party that stands for universal healthcare and says, we are not going to accept anything less. Right now in America so many people don't have the healthcare they need. That is a fact. 10s of millions of people including middle class people. Give them a chance--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470125	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	--through an election.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470126	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	This is not a republican talking point. Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare. Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat. 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. And in fact, what we got is a public option that in fact, would allow anybody to buy in. No one has to keep their private insurance. They can buy into this plan. And they can buy into it with a thousand dollar deductible and never have to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income when they do it. And if they don't have any money they get in free.

Let's talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year alone profited $72 billion, and that is on the backs of American families, and under your plan status quo, you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families.

Number two we should put some of these insurance executives who totally opposed my plan in jail for this 9 billion opioids they sell out there. They are misrepresenting to the American people what need to be done. And lastly, here's the deal, the deal is let's figure out how this works. We eat immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off their insurance plan, they don't like no matter what one it is and by into a Medicare option.

My immigration plan would also make sure that we put undocumented immigrants who having committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship, that we do a 21st century Marshall plan with Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala so that we can get to the root of this challenge so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come to the United States.

470148	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	The fact is what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum. That woman, the women she spoke to are entitled to asylum. That is not crossing the border illegally. What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly. With regard to seven--with regard to the secretary's point, I already proposed and passed	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

In addition to that, we're in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border, what do you say to all those people around the world who, in fact, want the same thing, to come to the United States and make their case, but they don't--that they--they have to wait in line? The fact of the matter is you should be able to--if you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back. It's a crime. It's a crime. And it's not one that, in fact--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470150	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Yeah. First of all, Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn't. Let me begin by telling you	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470151	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Let me just start out by answering that question. My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470152	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	--I agree--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470153	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	--Because we do have a problem with that. Secondly, the only way that we're going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations don't happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law. There's still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border. It's a civil action. Also, we have 654 miles of fencing. We have thousands of personnel at the border. We have planes. We have boats--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470157	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense. Here's the deal. The fact of the matter is that in fact, when people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum. People should have to get in line. That's the problem. And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump. We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470158	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	Our hearts break when we see those children at these detention facilities who've been separated from their parents, when we see human beings crowded into cages in abhorrent, inhumane conditions. This is about leadership and --	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470159	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	--understanding that we can and should have both secure borders as well as humane immigration policies. We will have to stop separating children from their parents, make it so that it's easier for people to seek asylum in this country, make sure that we are securing our borders, and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470160	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	I am the son of immigrants myself. My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 U.S. patents for GE and IBM. I think that's a pretty good deal for the United States. That's the immigration story we need to be telling. We can't always be focusing on some of the--the--the distressed stories. And if you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants, you will find wall-to-wall robots and machines. Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470161	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Absolutely. First of all, I just want to say again tonight, we are playing into Republican hands--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470162	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	--who have a very different view and they're trying to divide us against each other. I'm listening to the language of my colleagues. No, Mr. Vice President, we are not going to just let people cross the border. An unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing if you do it in the civil courts or if you do it through the criminal courts. But the criminal courts is what is getting Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country who no one surrenders their human rights.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470163	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	And so doing it through the civil courts means that you won't need these awful detention facilities that I have been to, seen children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children, this is not necessary. We have seen using the civil system piloted programs that have 100 percent compliance with the civil courts where people are evaluated. If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned. If they are, like the people I met in Juarez, who were survivors of sexual assault who we wouldn't even let come and present for asylum. We are butchering our values--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470164	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	--And making ourselves less safe.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470165	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	I agree with the senator. The asylum process is a real process and this president is ruining it. It has nothing to do with that section of the law. That's what he's doing. Number one. Number two, we should in fact, and we have proposed and we tried to get it passed in our administration, I proposed significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants that are able to come. This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people. And the reason we are the country we are is we been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture. Immigrants built this country. That's why we are so special. It took courage, it took resilience, it took absolute confidence for them to come and we should be encouraging--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470166	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	--people. And by the way, anybody across that crosses the stage with a--with a PhD should get a green card for seven years. We should keep them here.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470167	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Two points. One, it's all kind of a charade because there's 11 million people here and everyone in theory has broken the law, but they're part of our communities now. They're part of our economy. They are our neighbors. Why are we even discussing on one level whether it's a civil penalty or criminal penalty when it's in American reality? And what we need is comprehensive immigration reform once and for all to fix it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470168	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Second, Vice President Biden, I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations. You are vice president of the United States. I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not using your power, your influence in the White House. Did you think it was a good idea or did you think it was something that needed to be stopped?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470169	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	The president came along and he's the guy that came up with the idea, first time ever, of dealing with the Dreamers. He put that in the law. He--he talked about a comprehensive plan which he put on the--label for the Congress saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people. He said we should up the number of people that were able to bring into this country. Lastly, he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it where people were leaving in the first place. So he did--compare him to Donald Trump, I think is absolutely bizarre.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470170	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	I don't. I think it's important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as they have been living in the shadows. And instead of putting a band aid on this problem--fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenship so that they are no longer treated as second class citizens in this country. We have got to look at the challenge that people all across this country are facing under crushing student debt. This is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way. And I believe that it is our generation that has the bold, creative solutions to be able to solve it. This is about promise for our future. And we've got to make those kind of investments.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470171	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	I agree with the Congresswoman, but I don't hear an answer from the Vice President I'm confused. I asked the Vice President point blank did he use his power to stop those deportations. He went right around the question. Mr. Vice President, you want to be President of the United States. You need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you if you're debating Donald Trump, he's not going to let you off the hook. So, did you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the President and say, this is a mistake--we shouldn't do it? Which one?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470172	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	I was Vice President. I am not the President. I keep my recommendation in private. Unlike you I expect you would say what everyone said privately with him, but it's not what I do. What I do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system. That's what he did. That's what he did. And much more has to be done. Much more has to be done.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470173	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	I still don't hear an answer.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470174	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Well, couple things--first of all, Mr. Vice President, you can't have it both ways. You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can't do it when it's convenient.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470175	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	And then dodge it when it's not. And then the second thing, and this really irks me because I heard the Vice President say that--you got a PhD you can come right into this country. Well, that's playing into what the republicans want--to pit some immigrants against other immigrants.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470176	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Some are from shithole countries and some are from (INAUDIBLE) countries.

Don't let the republicans divide this party against itself.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470177	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	The fact is--that's what I said about this country. We are a country of immigrants, all of us. All of us. Some here came against their will. Others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives and they did. The (INAUDIBLE) that's what we're talking about. That's what made us great. And the fact of the matter is I think the President of the United States, Barack Obama, went out of his way to change the system and he got pushed back significantly.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470178	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Well I don't--I think he is wrong and I think we should work together. He has a similar plan. I think that we should change the way we look at prisons.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

But let me say we talk about criminal justice reform, there are a lot of things that we can talk about. Sentencing reform, cash bail reform, investing in public defenders, diversion programs. I'm proud that I'm the only candidate that has put forward a police reform plan because we have a police system that is broken--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470204	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	And we need to fix it. And whether it's the case of someone like Tamir Rice or Michael Brown or Eric Garner where the Trump Justice Department just decided not to pursue charges.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470205	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	We need to ensure we have a national use of force standard and that we end qualified immunity from police officers so that we can hold them accountable for using excessive force.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470206	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Well, then it's much more than that because what we see, this was a good example the other day of--of the Department of Justice not going after Officer Pantileo (SP) that--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470207	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	You know, Officer Pantileo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD. He did that for seven seconds. 11 different times, Eric Garner said that he couldn't breathe. He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice. That police officer should be off the street.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470208	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Well, let me tell you, I know the Garner family. They've gone through extraordinary pain. They are waiting for justice and they're going to get justice. There's finally going to be injustice, I have confidence in that, in the next 30 days in New York. You know why? Because for the first time, we are not waiting on the federal Justice Department, which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the Justice Department was pursuing their prosecution. And years went by and a lot of pain accrued. And in the meantime, what I'm making working on is making sure, and I have for five years, there will never be another tragedy, there will never be another Eric Garner because we are changing fundamentally how we police.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470209	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	But there's one less point I have to say about the Justice Department. The vice president for two and a half of those years, Mr. Vice President, tell us what did you do to try and spur on the Justice Department to act in the Garner case?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470210	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	We did a lot. Number one, we made sure we reduced the federal prison population by 38,000 people, number one. Number two, we in fact insisted that we change the rules that police engage in. They had to have--we provided for body cameras, we made sure that there were a lot of things that were changed in the process. But 38,000 people in the federal system were released under the system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470211	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	And so the fact is that there's a lot we've done. But here's the deal, the fact is that we are talking about things that occurred a long, long time ago. And now all of a sudden you know, I find it fascinating everybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues. Barack Obama knew exactly who I was. He had--he had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties and he chose me and he said it was the best decision he made.

470215	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	We cannot tear each other down. We have to focus on beating Donald Trump in 2020. I want to share a story that a prison guard, a corrections officer in New Hampshire said to me. He said we should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when they were behind bars. Right now we think we are saving money--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470216	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	We just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways.

470217	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	That is simply false. And let's be very clear about this. When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate working with segregationists to oppose busing, which was the vehicle by which we would integrate America's public schools--had I been in the United States Senate at that time, I would've been completely on the other side of the aisle. And let's be clear about this. Had those segregationists their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate. Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate. And Barack Obama would not have been in the position to nominate him to the title he now holds.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470218	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	And so, on that issue, we could not be more apart, which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time. Now, I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner because I, too, met with his mother. And one of the things that we've got to be clear about is that this president of the United States, Donald Trump, while he has been in office has quietly been allowing the United--United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees, to stop pattern and practice investigations. On that case, we also know that the--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

And she did not--in fact, I didn't see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them. Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that, in fact, was abusing people's rights and the fact was that she, in fact, was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me that you, in fact, have been--the police officer did something that did not give you the information would explicate your--your--your client. She didn't do that. She never did it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470239	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a decision and an impact in these people's lives you did not and worse yet, in the case of those who are on death row, innocent people you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so.

470241	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	My entire career I have been opposed, personally opposed to the death penalty and that has never changed. And I dare anybody who is in a position to make that decision to face the people I have faced to say, I will not seek the death penalty. That is my background. That is my work. I am proud of it. I think you can judge people by when they are under fire and it's not about some fancy opinion on a stage. But when they are in a position to actually make the decision, what do they do? When I was in the position on having to decide whether or not to seek a death penalty on cases I prosecuted I made a very difficult decision that was not popular--to not seek the death penalty. History shows that and I am proud of those decisions.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

They are even worse still. A study just came out that projected the average American--African-American median net worth will be (INAUDIBLE). So you have to ask yourself how is that possible?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470243	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	It is possible because we are in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in our history. Artificial intelligence is coming. It's going to displace hundreds of thousands of call-center workers, truck drivers, the most common job in 29 states, including this one. And you know who suffers most in a natural disaster. It's people of color, people who have lower levels of capital and education and resources.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470244	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	So what are we going to do about it? We should just go back to the writings of Martin Luther King who in 1967 his book chaos in our communities said we need a guaranteed minimum income in the United States of America.

First of all, one of things that we--we are responsible for 15 percent of all the pollution in the country. He's right about how it affects people and it affects neighborhoods, particularly poor neighborhoods. But here's the deal, in that area, there's also another piece. 85 percent of it is something I helped to negotiate, and that is the Paris climate accord. I would immediately rejoined that Paris Accord, I would make sure that we up the ante, which it calls for, I would be able to bring those leaders together who I know, I'd--I'd convene them in the White House like we did the nuclear summit, and I would raise the standard.

We like to act as if we are 100 percent, but the truth is even if we were to curb our emissions dramatically, the earth is still going to get warmer. And we can see it around us this summer. The last four years have been the four warmest years in recorded history. This is going to be a tough truth, but we are too late. We are 10 years too late. We need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction, but we also need to start moving our people to higher ground.

I was secretary of housing in urban development when Flint had its water crisis. We did what it could to help folks get water filters and then we didn't stop there. We improved the standard of how we deal with elevated lead levels in children. A lot of Americans don't know that this is still a major problem out there. I was back in Flint about six weeks ago and I released a plan to invest $50 billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat. We need to do it. We can do it and I will do it.

And as for how to win in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind. What we have to do is we have to say look, there's record high GDP in stock market prices. You know what also had record highs? Suicides, drug overdoses, depression, anxiety. It has gotten so bad that American life expectancy has declined for the last three years. And I like to talk about my wife who is at home with our two boys right now. One of whom is autistic.

He said he was going to help farmers; he said he was going to help auto workers. Farmers are now looking at bankruptcy, soybeans rotting in bills. Autoworkers, we expect perhaps hundreds of thousands will be out of jobs by the end of the year. Jerome Powell just dropped the interest rates, and he admitted why because of the so-called trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the Trump trade tax that has resulted in American families spending as much as $1.4 billion more a month on everything from shampoo to washing machines. He betrayed the American people. He betrayed of American families, and he will lose this election--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470292	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	--because folks are clear that he has done nothing except try to beat people down and instead of live people up and that is what we want in the next president of the United States.

470293	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Well, first of all, there are a lot of Americans right now that are hurting. Just go and ask the folks that just received notice that they're going to get laid off by General Motors or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the United States or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can't provide for their families or pay the rent. So the idea that America is doing just fine is wrong. Not only that, this president always likes to take credit like he did this. We've now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history. Over 80 months of that was due to President Barack Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama.

470294	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Thank you, Barack Obama.

Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470295	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	By pushing for fair trade, not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country, that giveaway American jobs, and that threaten our environment. These are the three main issues with that massive trade deal, the transpacific partnership. I think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass, either a federal law or a state or a local law. This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country, not (SP) to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment. These are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy.

470296	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	I would not because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan, and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers who are already struggling, and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.

470297	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	I'd renegotiate it. We make up 25 percent of the world's economy.

We have to join with the 40 percent of the world that we had with us, and this time make sure that there's no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there and to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now in the things that make them more competitive.

470312	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned, particularly in startups and entrepreneurship.

Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470313	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitative in abusive jobs and relationships around the country. I'm talking about the waitress who's getting harassed by her boss at the diner who might have a business idea, but right now is stuck where she is. What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses. And the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of $1,000 a month into their hands.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470314	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	It would be a game changer for women around the country because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society.

470315	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I think that's support of my proposal, which is this. Since 1963, when we passed the Equal Pay Act, we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work. Fast forward to the year of our (INAUDIBLE) 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar; black women, 61 cents; Native American women, 58 cents; Latinas, 53 cents. I'm done with the conversation. So, yes, I am proposing in order to deal with this, one, I'm going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work. Two, they will be fined for every 1 percent differential between what they are paying men and women. They will be fined 1 percent of their previous year's profits. That'll get everybody's attention.

470346	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do. Listen, we all watched the his testimony. I read the report. There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable. I've seen people go to prison--go to prison for far less. And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice who says the sitting president cannot be indicted. I believe the American people are right there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law including the president of the United States.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470347	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	My response is exactly that. I've read the report. I've read the redacted versions of there report. We have something that is astonishing going on in the United States of America. We have a president that is not acting like a leader of the free world. He is acting like an authoritarian against the actual constitution that he swore an oath to uphold. And so, this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470348	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	I believe that we in the United States congress should start impeachment proceedings immediately.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470349	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	And I tell you this, Debbie Stabana(PH) has now joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings because he is now stonewalling congress. Not allowing to subjecting themselves to the checks and balances. He swore an oath to uphold the constitution. The politics of this be damned. When we look back in history at what happened when the president of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world the question is is what will we have done? And I believe that congress should do its job.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470350	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Well, I agree. I was the first of the candidates to call on congress to begin impeachment proceedings. There are 10 different instances that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice. And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings. As to the question of what my Department of Justice might do. I believe with those that say the president should not direct attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470351	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far that you are likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470352	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	I think it's obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worth of impeachment. That I want to caution my fellow democrats while we move when every way we can for impeachment we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives. And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470353	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	We need more talk about working people and their lives. For example, are we really ready--and I ask people on this stage this question-- are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes? That's something every American wants to know about. That's something they want answers to right now. So yeah, move to impeachment but don't forget to do the people's business and stand up for working people because that's how we are actually going to beat Donald Trump. The best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470354	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Let me first say that I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. All of us have a vision for the future of the country that we are articulating to the American people. We continue to do that. We have an election coming up. At the same time senator I think that too many folks in the senate and in the congress have been spooked by 1998. I think that the times are different. In fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursing impeachment. The Mueller report clearly details that he deserves it and what is going to happen in the fall of next year of 2020 if they don't impeach him is he is going to say you see--you see the democrats didn't go after me on impeachment and you know why? Because I didn't do anything wrong.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470355	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	These folks that always investigate me, they are always trying to go after me--when it came down to it they didn't go after me because I didn't do anything wrong. Conversely, if Mitch McConnell is the one that lets him off the hook we are going to be able to say sure, they impeached--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470356	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	Let him off the hook.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470357	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-07-31	--Well, my brother can. He is here tonight.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470358	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	Thank you. For the last three years, we've watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other, black versus white, citizen versus immigrant, and why? So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else. We can't let them get away with it. If we're going to beat Donald Trump, this has to be a party that stands for something. This has to be the party of labor unions. This has to be the party of universal healthcare. This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470359	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-07-31	And when we do that, Donald Trump, right on cue, will call us socialist. Well, here's what I'll say to him. Donald, you are the real socialist. The problem is, it's socialism for the rich. We here in this country, we don't have to take it anymore. We can fight back. If you agree that we can stand up to Donald Trump and we can stand up to the wealthy, then go to taxthehell.com and join us so we can build a country--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

470361	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	Thank you. You know, Donald Trump and warmongering politicians in Washington have failed us. They continue to escalate tensions with other nuclear arm countries, like Russia and China and North Korea, starting a new Cold War, pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. Now, as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us. And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, we would 30 minutes--30 minutes before we were hit and you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say, incoming missile, seek immediate shelter, this is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470362	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	And you would see, as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter. This is the warmonger's hoax. There is no shelter. It's all a lie.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470363	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	As president, I will end this insanity because it doesn't have to be this way. I will end these wasteful regime change wars, work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to deescalate these tensions. And take the trillions of dollars that we've been wasting on these wars and on these weapons and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home. Things like Healthcare for All, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470364	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-07-31	The needs are great. As your president, I will put your interest above all else.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470365	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	You know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate? It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on this stage in polling. It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan, we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show. It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470366	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Andrew Yang	2019-07-31	We need to be laser focused on solving the real challenges of today. Like the fact that the most common job--jobs in America may not exist in a decade or that most Americans cannot pay their bills. My flagship proposal, the freedom dividend, would put $1000 a month into the hands of every American adult, be a game changer for millions of American families. If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear, enter your zip code at yang2020.com and see what $1000 a month would mean to your community. I have done the math. It's not left, it's not right, it's forward, and that's how we are going to beat Donald Trump in 2020.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470367	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Thank you. First, I just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of Detroit. They are hosting us today, and one of the reasons I respect the city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark. And Detroit is turning around, and Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demeanor degrade us or underestimate our worth. We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause. That's the history of this city. My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470368	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	Who was a UAW worker. My grandfather who pulled his family out of poverty and oppression. My grandmother joined him. She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundromat right here in the city. That is the American dream. And so many of us have stories like that, but the dream of this country is under threat right now. Well, my mom's a generation, 80, 95% of baby boomers did better than their parents. It's now just a coin toss for millennials. We have a real crises--crises in our country, and the crises is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470369	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-07-31	I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump. Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling. The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him, he wants to take all the oxygen out of the room, it’s when we start focusing on each other and understanding that our common bonds and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before, it's going it's what's going to save us now. That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as president of the United States, not just uniting the Democratic Party, but making sure that we put more indivisible back into this one nation under God. And if you believe, like I do, please go to corybooker.com and join the mission.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470370	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	So in my background as Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks who preyed on the homeowners, many of whom lost their homes and will never be able to buy another. I've taken on the for-profit colleges who preyed on students, put them out of business. I've preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children, and I will tell you we have a predator living in the White House.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470371	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	And I’m going to tell you something. Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts. And the thing about predators is this, by their very nature, they prey on people they perceive to be weak. They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable. They prey on people who are in need of help, often desperate for help. And predators are cowards.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470372	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Kamala Harris	2019-07-31	What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years. And let me tell you, we've got a long rap sheet. We’re looking at someone who passed the tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families. We've got a person who has put babies in cages and separated children from their parents. We have someone who passed a so-called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families. So we must defeat him and then, in turning the page, write the next chapter for our country. And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at 3:00 in the morning. And that is my agenda, the 3:00 a.m. agenda that is focused on getting folks the jobs they need, getting their children the education they need, making sure they have the healthcare they need in the future they deserve. So please join me at kamalaharris.org, and I think you for your time.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN

We are in a battle for the soul of America. This is the most consequential election in the one of you no matter how old or young you are has ever--ever participated in. Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration, hard to overcome the damage he has done, but we can overcome it. Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way, the America we know will no longer exist.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 31 | CNN
470375	CNN HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Joe Biden	2019-07-31	Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let them know who we are. We choose science over fiction. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division, and we choose--we choose the idea that we can assess Americans when we react together do anything. This is the United States of America. We have acted together we have never--never, never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was. If you agree with me, go to joe30330 and help me in this fight. Thank you very much.
