753281	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	So I think of it this way, who is this economy really working for? It's doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. It's doing great for giant drug companies. This is not doing great for people are trying to get a prescription filled. It's doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons just not for the African-Americans and Latinx whose families are torn apart whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753282	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	It's doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us. When you've got a government--when you've got an economy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great for everyone else that is corruption, pure and simple.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753283	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	We need to call it out. We need to attack it had on and we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753284	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	Well, first, the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what is going on when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums. So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids; I do.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753285	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	But I think my plan is a good one and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education. My own dad and my sister got their first agrees with community college. There's many paths to success as well as certifications.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753286	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	Secondly I would use programs. I would double them from $6000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered up to families that make up to $100,000. And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans because I can tell you this, if billionaires--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753288	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	This economy has got to work for everyone and right now we know that it isn't and it's going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does. (UNTRANSLATED)	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753289	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	Right now we have a system that favors those that can pay for access and outcomes, that is how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest. A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753290	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	A new democracy that is revised because we have returned power to the people, no pacts, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753291	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	That's how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753292	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	I would support a--a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital at the same rate--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753293	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	--that you--you tax ordinary income. Take the corporate tax rate up to 28 percent. You would generate the revenues--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753295	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	I don't think I disagree. I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation. You see the evidence of that in how dignity is being strip from labor and we a people who work full-time jobs and still can't make a living wage.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753296	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs and use see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that is hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753297	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector. So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753298	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	And I will tell you this I live in a low-income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used from GDP to Wall Street's rankings is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753299	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	Well, again I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. And when it comes to antitrust law what I would do is number one appoint judges that will enforce it; number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753300	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	At the end of the day we have too much of a problem with corporate-	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753301	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	--on the Affordable Care Act, and that is a public option. I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in a four years, which is exactly what this bill says.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753302	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	So, let me go on beyond that. There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals. The president literally went on TV on Fox and said that people's heads would spend when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office. Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies. For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that's what we call at home all foam and no beer. We got nothing out of it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753303	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	And so, my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries. And pharma thinks they own Washington. Well, they don't own me.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753304	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	So, yes, I'm with Bernie on Medicare for All, and let me tell you why. I've spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is the cost of healthcare, medical bills. And that's not just for people who don't have insurance. It's for people who have insurance.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753305	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	Look at the business model of an insurance company. It's to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your healthcare. That leaves families with rising premiums, rising co-pays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the healthcare that their doctors say that they and their children need. Medicare for All solves that problem.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753306	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	And I understand there are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible. We just can't do it. It's--have a lot of political reasons for this. What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Well, healthcare is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753307	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	That means Medicare for All.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753308	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have healthcare. In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man, 27 years old, told me that he'd been to a doctor once in his life. And on that visit, he was told he had diabetes, was told he had glaucoma, and he was told untreated, because he doesn't have healthcare, he'll be dead before the age of 40.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753309	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	So, getting to guaranteed, high quality, universal healthcare as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal; the ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, the--the ability to see a mental health care provider. In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753310	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	And healthcare also has to mean that every woman can make our own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753311	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Beto O'Rourke	2019-06-26	Our plan says that if you're uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare. If you're insufficiently in short, you can afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare. But if you're a member of a union that negotiated for a healthcare plan that you like because it works for you--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753329	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-06-26	Why are you defending private insurance to begin with?	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753330	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	--Yes--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753331	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	I think we're talking about this in the wrong way. You're talking about one bill over another bill. Really, what we're talking about is our objective, making sure that every single American in this country is able to get the health care that they need. I believe Medicare for All is the way to do that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753332	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	I also think that employers recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare for All program, a program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality healthcare that they need.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753333	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	--I also think if you--if you look at other countries in the world who have universal healthcare, every one of them has some form of a role of--of private insurance. I think that's what we've got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need regardless--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753334	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Tulsi Gabbard	2019-06-26	--Of how much or little money they have in their pocket.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753335	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	I absolutely will. First of all, we're talking about this as a healthcare issue. But in communities like mine, low income communities, it's an education issue because kids who don't have healthcare are not going to succeed in school. It is an issue for jobs--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753336	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	--And employment because people that do not have good health care do not succeed at work. It's even a retirement issue because, in my community, African-Americans have a lower life expectancy because of the poorer health care.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753337	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	And so, where I stand is very clear. Healthcare is not just a human right, it should be an American right. And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for All. But I have an urgency about this. When I am president of the United States, I'm not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753338	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	And on this debate, I'm sorry. There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America from the--from pharmaceutical companies to insurers. Literally, the overhead for insurers that they charge is 15 percent, while Medicare's overhead is only at 2 percent. We can do this better, and every single day I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable cost until we get to my goal--	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753343	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	--Point though. And that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the healthcare system, $23 billion, and that doesn't count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington. We have a giant industry that wants our healthcare system to stay the way it is, because it's not working for families but it's sure as heck working for them.

753347	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	I just want to say there's three women appear that have fought pretty hard for a woman's right to choose, so I'll start with that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753348	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal healthcare. And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved. You could do it either way. At its--the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered. So, I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you moved to universal healthcare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753349	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-06-26	Yes, it would. I don't believe only in reproductive freedom. I believe in reproductive justice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

So, I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion. More than that everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today a person's right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri and Alabama, in Georgia. I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v Wade and will respect.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753352	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Julian Castro	2019-06-26	And in addition to that make sure that we fight hard as we transition our healthcare system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753353	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive healthcare services and that includes birth control, it includes abortion, it includes everything for a woman.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753354	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Elizabeth Warren	2019-06-26	And, I want to add on that--it's not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us. 47 years ago Roe versus Wade was decided and we've all looked to the courts all that time. As state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions has come right up to the age of taking away protection.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753357	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	--I will not take contributions from corporate tax or pharma executives because they are part of this problem. And this opioid addiction in our country we in cities like mine have been seeing how we have been trying to arrest our way out of addiction for too long. It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical that are responsible help to--help to pay for that.

It's the largest prison population on the face of the planet. Many are there for non-violent drug crimes including possession of marijuana at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized. And despite what Purdue Pharma has done--their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we're seeing throughout this country they've been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences not a single night in jail. Unless there's accountability and justice this crisis will continue. In my administration we will hold them to account. We will make sure that they pay a price and we will help those that have been a victim of these malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long-term care.

If I were president I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump's zero tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy and the metering policy. This metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river--river. They have been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at the ports of entry. Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim. So, they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river and they died because of that.

What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here and that is that seventy of our Fortune five hundred companies are headed up by people that came from other countries, twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel Laureates were born in other countries. We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories, we need them to start small businesses. We need their ideas and this president has literally gone backwards at a time where our economy needs immigrants.

753404	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	Well, this is a related and brief point because what we are talking about--what Secretary Castro and I are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process. I have been to some of the largest private persons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and they are immigration lockups. Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things whether it's immigration, whether it's mental illness, whether it's addiction. We know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solve this problem.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753405	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	Donald Trump is in solving this problem. We've seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place and we make sure we use our resources to provide healthcare, to affirm the values of human dignity that people that come here because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News
753406	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal. And one of the reasons why we are seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of the deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and push back a nuclear breakout 10--20 years. And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled--being pulled in further and further into this crisis.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

But my point is, and it's important for us to recognize this, is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton and others are creating a situation that just a spark would light up a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous.

Someone I knew Shahad Smith(PH) was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year. For millions of Americans this is not a policy issue this is an urgency.

I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe High School shooting. A young student named Bree (PH), her friend Marcell (PH), who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Heart (PH). They talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole. We know that they save lives. Talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.

If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity then we will have set a new standard and that is that some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law and we cannot allow that to stand.

And if we have not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows and under my administration our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability and there is justice. It is the only way that we save this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - June 26 (Full) | NBC News

753514	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Bill de Blasio	2019-06-26	It matters, it matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party, that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didn't just talk about it but gave people $15 minimum wage. It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken health care system and gave people universal healthcare. It matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied pre-K and gave it to every single one of them for free. These things really matter.

I have a track record of passing over a hundred bills where I am the lead Democrat and that is because I listened and I acted and I think that's important in a President; everything else just melts away.

753524	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Amy Klobuchar	2019-06-26	Secondly, I'm someone that can win and beat Donald Trump. I have won every place, every race and every time. I have won in the reddest of districts, ones that Donald Trump won by over 20 points. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Iowa and Michigan. And finally, yeah, I am not the establishment party candidate. I've got respect but I'm not that person. I am the one that doesn't have a political machine that doesn't come from money and I don't make all of the promises that everyone up here makes but I can promise you this, I am going to govern with integrity, I'm going to have your back and I'm going to govern for you.

Fifty years ago this month my family moved into the town I grew up in because after being denied a house because of the color of their skin, it was activists, mostly white activists that stood up and fought for them. That's the best of who we are as America and why when I got out of law school I moved into the inner city of Newark(SP) to fight as a tenant lawyer for other people's rights.

753526	NBC NEWS HOLDS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE	Cory Booker	2019-06-26	I have taken on bullies and beat them. I've taken on tough fights and we've won and we win those fights not by showing the worst of who we are but rising to whose best. Donald Trump wants us to fight him on his turf and his terms. We will beat him. I will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again. This is a referendum on him and getting rid of him but it's also a referendum on us, who we are and who we must be to each other. It's time we win this election and the way I'll govern is by showing the best of who we are because that's what this country needs and deserves.
