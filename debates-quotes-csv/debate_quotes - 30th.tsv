737294	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Last year, Democrats flipped 40 Republican seats in the House, and not one of those 40 Democrats support the policies of our front runners at center stage. Now, I share their progressive values, but I'm a little more pragmatic. I was out of work for two whole years until I started what became the largest brewpub in America. And I learned the small best--the small business lessons of how to provide service and teamwork and became a top mayor, and as governor of Colorado, created the number one economy in the country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737295	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	We also expanded healthcare and reproductive rights. We attacked climate change head on. We beat the NRA. We did not build massive government expansions. Now, some will promise a bill tonight or a plan for tonight, but we focused on was making sure that we got people together to get things done, to--to provide solutions to problems, to make sure that we--that we worked together and created jobs. That's how we're going to be Donald Trump, that's how we are going to win Michigan in the country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737296	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	Let's get real. Tonight, we debate, but ultimately, we have to beat Donald Trump. My background, it's a little bit different than his. I stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner, as a daughter of a union teacher and a newspaperman, as the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the state of Minnesota and a candidate for president of the United States. That's because we come from a country of shared dreams and I have had it with the racist attacks. I have had it with the president says one thing on TV that has your back and then you get home and you see those charges for prescription drugs and cable and college.

737297	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	You're going to hear a lot of promises up here, but I'm going to tell you this. Yes, I have bold ideas, but they are grounded in reality. And yes, I will make some simple promises. I can win this. I'm from the Midwest and I have won every race, every place, every time, and I will govern with integrity, the integrity worthy of the extraordinary people of this nation.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737298	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	I'm running for president because I believe that America discovers its greatness and its moments of greatest need. This moment will define us forever and I believe that in this test, America will be redeemed. In the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president, we will choose to be the nation that stands up for the human rights of everyone, for the rule of law for everyone, and democracy that serves everyone. Whatever our differences, we know that before we are anything else, we are Americans first and we will ensure that each one of us is well enough and educated enough and paid enough to realize our full potential.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737299	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	We will meet these challenges here at home and we will lead the world in those that we face abroad, successfully confronting endless war and climate change. At this moment of truth, let us pursue our national promise and make a more perfect union of everyone, by everyone, and for everyone.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737300	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	I'm running for president because our country is running out of time. It is even bigger than the emergency of the Trump presidency. Ask yourself how somebody like Donald Trump ever gets within cheating distance of the oval office in the first place. It doesn't happen unless America is already in a crisis, an economy that not working for everyone, endless war, climate change. We have lived this. In my industrial Midwestern hometown, my generation has lived this as long as we have been alive, and it's only accelerating.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737301	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate. By 2030, the average house in this country will cost $.5 million and a woman's right to choose may not even exist. We are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments number policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive. We've got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different. This is our shot.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737302	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	That is why I am running for president.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737303	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Donald Trump disgraces the office of presidents every single day and anyone on this stage tonight or tomorrow night would be a far better president. I promise no matter who our candidate is I will work my heart out to beat Donald Trump and to elect a Democratic Congress.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737304	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	But our problems didn't start with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is part of a corrupt rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else. We are not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737305	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	We are going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big structural change. We need to be the party that fights for our democracy and our economy to work for everyone. I know what's broken in this country, I know how to fix it and I will fight to make it happen.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737306	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Tonight in America as we speak 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured but the healthcare industry made $100 billion in profits last year. Tonight as we speak right now 500,000 Americans are sleeping out on the street and yet companies like Amazon that made billions in profits did not pay one nickel in federal income tax. Tonight half of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck and yet 49 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. Tonight the fossil fuel industry continues to receive hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks while they destroyed this planet. We have got to take on trumps racism, his sexism, xenophobia and come together in an unprecedented--unprecedented grassroots movement to not only defeat Trump but to transform our economy and our government.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737307	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	You are wrong.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737308	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Right now we have a dysfunctional health care system, 87 million uninsured or underinsured, 500,000--500,000 Americans every year are going bankrupt because of medical bills, 30,000 people dying while the healthcare industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit. Five minutes away from here, John, is a country called Canada. They guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a human right. They spend half of what we spend and by the way when you end up in a hospital in Canada you come out with no bill at all. Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege. I believe that. I will fight for that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737309	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	My name was also mentioned in this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737310	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	The fact of the matter is tens of millions of people lose their health insurance every single year when they change jobs or their employer changes that insurance. If you want stability in the healthcare system, if you want a system which gives you freedom of choice with regard to doctor or hospital which is a system which will not bankrupt you the answer is to get rid of the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737316	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	So, look--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737317	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--Let's--let's be clear about this. We are the democrats. We are not about trying to take away healthcare from anyone. That's what the republicans are trying to do.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737318	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	And we should stop using republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that healthcare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737319	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Now, I want to have a chance to tell the story about my friend, Eddie Barkin (PH). Eddie is 35 years old. He has a wife, Rachel (PH). He has a cute little boy named Carl. He also has ALS and it's killing him. Eddie has health insurance. Good health insurance.

737322	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--No, this is important.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737323	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	All right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737324	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--So--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737325	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--Giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more. Middle class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their healthcare. And I'd like to finish talking about Eddie, the guy who has ALS.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737326	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	This isn't funny. This is somebody who has health insurance and is dying. And every month, he has about $9,000 in medical gill--bills that his insurance company won't cover. His wife, Rachel, is on the phone for hours and hours and hours begging the insurance company, please cover what the doctors say he needs. He talks about what it's like to go online with thousands of other people to beg friends, family, and strangers for money so he can cover his medical expenses. The basic profit model of an insurance company is taking as much as money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in healthcare coverage. That is not working for--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737330	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations. For middle class families, costs--total costs will go down.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737333	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--Hey--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737334	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	So, we don't have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option will be better than--or a Medicare for All environment will be better than the corporate options. We can put it to the test. That's the concept of my Medicare for All Who Want It proposal. That way, if people like me are right, that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive, but more affordable than any other corporate options around there, we'll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option and it will become Medicare for All--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737339	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	I think you can buy into it. That's the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. Look, this is a distinction without a difference, whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums. Look, in this country, if you have health coverage--if you don't have health coverage, you're paying too much for care. And if you do have health coverage, you're paying--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737340	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--Too much for care.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737341	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	The answer is no, the middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world class healthcare. I think we're being offered in a false choice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737342	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	Some who want to improve the affordable care act at the margins. Others who want a Medicare for all program that will force people off of private insurance. I have a better path--Medicare for America. Everyone who is uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow. Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled in Medicare.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737344	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	You have some, Governor Bullock, who said that we will improve the affordable care act at the margins with a public option. You have others to my right who are talking about taking away people's choice for the private insurance that they have or members of unions. I was listening today--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737345	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	His--his (INAUDIBLE) they are offering a false choice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737346	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	Every--every estimate that I've seen of expanding ACA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the healthcare that they need as the example that Senator Warren showed us. Our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in Medicare or can keep their employer sponsored insurance. When we listen to the American people and this is what they want us to do--they want everyone covered but they want to be able to maintain choice and our plan does that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737347	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	That is incorrect. I just have a better way to do this. And in one of my first debates, Jake, I was called a street fighter from the iron range by my opponent. And when she said it I said, thank you. So, this is what I think we need to get done. We need the public option. That's what Barack Obama wanted and it would bring healthcare costs down for everyone. And by the way, I just don't buy this. I've heard some of these candidates say that it somehow not moral if you -- not moral to not have that public option. Well Senator Sanders was actually on a public option bill last year and that was Bernie the Medicaid public option bill that Senator Schatz introduced. Clearly, this is the easiest way to move forward quickly and I want to get things done. People can't wait. I've got my friend Nicole out there whose son was actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager and he died because he didn't have enough money to pay for it. And Bernie and I have worked on pharmaceutical (INAUDIBLE) together--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737348	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	We can get health expenses (INAUDIBLE).	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737349	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	As the author of the Medicare bill let me clear up one thing--as people talk about having insurance there are millions of people who have insurance they can't go to the doctor and when they come out of the hospital they go bankrupt, all right?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737350	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	What I am talking about and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no copayments. And Jake, your question is a republican talking point. At the end of the day and by the way--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737351	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	And by the way, by the way the healthcare industry will be advertising tonight on this program.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737352	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Oh, can I complete that please?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737353	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	They are advertising tonight with that talking point.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737354	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	We need to think of this in terms of the big frame. What's the problem in Washington? It works great for the wealthy. It works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers. And it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies. What it's going to take is real courage to fight back against them. These insurance companies do not have a god given right to make $23 billion in profits and suck it out of our healthcare system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737358	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Well obviously, I disagree with that, as much as I respect both of the senators to my right. You know, I think it comes down to that question of Americans being used to being able to make choices, to have the right to make a decision. And I think proposing a public option that allows some form of Medicare but maybe as accommodation of--of Medicare Advantage and Medicare, but people choose it and if enough people choose it, it--it expands, the quality improves, the cost comes down, or people choose it. Eventually, in 15 years, you could get there, but it would be an evolution, not a revolution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737359	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	You know--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737360	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--We have tried this experiment with the insurance companies and what they've done is they've sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system and they force people to have to fight to try to get the healthcare coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need. Why does everybody--why does every doctor, why does every hospital have to fill out so many collocated forms? It's because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737361	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	That's what we have to fight.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737363	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--If--it's true that if we embrace a far-left agenda, they are going to say we are a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what we are--they're going to do? They're going to say we are a bunch of crazy socialist. So let's just stand up for the right policy--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737364	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Go out there and defend it. That's a policy I'm putting forward, not because I think is the right triangulation between Republicans here and to progress there, because I think it's the right answer for people like my mother-in-law who is here whose life was saved by the ACA but who is still far too vulnerable to the fact of the insurance industry--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737367	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Let's be clear what this debate is about. Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system. What we are taking at--on is the fact that over the last 20 years the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent $4.5 billion dollars of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions. That is why when I went to Canada the other day people paid a 10th the price in Canada for insulin--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737369	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, two things.

737373	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	And second of all--second of all, many of our union brothers and sisters, nobody more pro-union than me up here, are now paying high deductibles in copayments. And when we do Medicare for All, instead of having the company putting money on-	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737375	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Under Medicare for all the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they are not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today.

737377	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare but our job is to run a nonprofit health care system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737380	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Hospitals will be better off than they are today.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737381	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	When I am president illegally crossing the border will still be a legal. We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law but we've got a crisis on our hands and it's not just a crisis of immigration, it's a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border. It is the stain on the United States of America.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737382	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Americans want comprehensive immigration reform and frankly we have been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime. Protections for dreamers, making sure that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, cleaning up lawful immigration. We know what to do. We know the border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737383	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	The problem is we haven't had the will to get it done in Washington and now we have a president who could fix it in a month because there is that bipartisan agreement but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement. That will end on my watch.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737384	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	So in my view if fraud is involved in that is suitable for the criminal statute. If not then it should be handled under civil law but the show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737385	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	We appreciate that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737386	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	I do because in my administration after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders, more than 9 million of our fellow Americans free dreamers many fear of deportation and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge and for-profit detention in this country and assisted those countries in Central America so that no family ever has to make that 2000 mile journey then I expect that people who come here follow our laws and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737387	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	So, the problem is that right now the criminalization statute is what gives Donald Trump the ability to take children away from their parents it's what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders. We need to continue to have border security and we can do that. But what we can't do is not live our values. I've been down to the border. I have seen the mothers. I have seen the pages of babies. We must be a country that everyday lives our values and that means we cannot make it a crime--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737388	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--Yes--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737389	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	The point is not about criminalization that has given Donald Trump the tool to break families apart.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737390	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	We need--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737391	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Well, I agree that we need to secure borders. There's no question about that and the--the frustration with what's going on in Washington is they are kicking the ball back and forth. Secure the borders. Make sure whatever law we have doesn't allow children to be snatched from their parents and put in cages. How hard can that be? We got I don't know on the two debate nights we got 170 years of Washington experience somehow that seems like it should be fairly fixable.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737392	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Well, and one way to fix it is to decriminalize. That's the whole point. What we're looking for here is a way to take away the tools that Donald Trump has--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737393	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--used to break up families.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737394	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	I would say there is the will to change this in congress. What's missing is the right person in the White House. I believe that immigrants don't diminish America. They are America. And if you want to do something about border security you first of all change the rules so that people can seek asylum in those Northern Triangle countries. Then you pass the bill and what the bill will do is it will greatly reduce the deficit and give us the money for border security and for border processing the cases. And most of all, it will allow for a path to citizenship. Because this is not just about the border. Donald Trump wants to use these people as political pawns.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737395	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	We have people all over our country that simply want to work and obey the law.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737396	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	We have a strong border protections. But the main point I want to make is that what Trump is doing through his racism and his xenophobia is demonizing a group of people. And as president I will end that demonization. If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path in my view they are not criminals.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737397	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	They are people fleeing violence. And I think the main thing that we've got to do--among many others--Beto made this point--we got to ask ourselves, why are people walking 2000 miles to a strange country where they don't know the language? So what we will do the first week we are in the White House is bring the entire hemisphere together to talk about how we (INAUDIBLE) Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737398	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--so people do not have to flee their own countries.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737399	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	I think that what we have to do is we have to be an America that is clear about what we want to do with immigration. We need to expand legal immigration, we need to create a path for citizenship not just for dreamers. But for grandmas and for people who have been working here in the farms	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737400	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	for students who have overstayed their visas.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737401	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	We need to fix the crisis at the border. And a big part of how we do that is we do not play into Donald Trump's hands.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737402	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--He wants to stir up the crisis at the border because that's his overall message. It's if there's anything wrong in your life--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737403	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--Blame them.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737404	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--No--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737405	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Well, what you're saying is ignore the law. Laws matter and it matters if we say our law is that we will lock people up who come here seeking refuge, who come here--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737406	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--Seeking asylum. That is not a crime. And as Americans, what we need to do is have a sane system that keeps us safe at the border, but does not criminalize the activity--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737407	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--Of a mother--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737408	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--Fleeing here for safety.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737409	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, I--two things. A sane immigration policy moves the comprehensive immigration reform. It (INAUDIBLE) to a humane border policy in which, by the way, we have enough administrative judges so that we don't have incredible backlogs that we have right now. But, to answer your question, I happen to believe that when I talk about healthcare as a human right that applies to all people in this country. And under a Medicare for All, single payer system, we could afford to do that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737410	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Well, this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community, too, far too many times. It's the worst part of being mayor, getting the phone call, consoling grieving parents. And we have a mass shootings worth of killings every day in this country. What we're doing hasn't worked because we haven't had a system in Washington capable of delivering what the American people have told us they want. Eighty--90 percent of republicans want universal background checks, not to mention the common sense solutions, like red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers and flag mental health risks and an end to assault weapons. Things like what I carried overseas in uniform that have no business in American neighborhoods in peace time, let alone anywhere near a school.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737411	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	I--I was at an event a few days ago and a 13 year old asked me what we were going to do about school safety and then began shaking and then began crying. And we could talk about these policies, but we already know the policies. The only thing I could think of, looking into the eyes of this child, is we're supposed to be dealing with this so you--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737412	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--don't have to. High school is hard enough without having to worry about whether you are going to get shot and when 90 percent of Americans want something to happen--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737413	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	And Washington can't deliver--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737414	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	We can't expect the same--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737415	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	I disagree with his diagnosis of the problem.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737416	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Well, this is the fundamental nonsense of government. Another thing--another place where despite our best efforts we can't seem to make any progress and when I went to the--to the movie theater in Aurora in 2012 and saw that footage of what happened, back crime scene I will never forget it and we decided you know that we were going to go out and take on the--the NRA and we passed as a purple state we passed universal background checks. We limited magazine capacity. We did the basic work that for whatever reason doesn't seem to be able to get done in Washington.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737417	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	This isn't just about a system or it's not just about words. This is a about the NRA. I have sat across from the president of the United States after Parkland because I have been a leader on these issues and have the bill to close the boyfriend loophole and I watched and wrote down when nine times he said he wanted universal background checks. The next day he goes and he meets with the NRA and he folds. As you are president I will not fold. I will make sure that we get universal background checks passed, the assault weapons ban, that we do something about magazines and that we understand when that six little--little six-year-old boy died, Stephen Romero, when his dad said he is only six years old all I can say is--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737418	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	All I can say is he is six years old.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737419	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	We have to remember that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737420	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	This is the exact same conversation we've been having since--since I was in high school. I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened. I was part of the first generation that saw a routine school shootings. We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country. We dare not allow there to be a third. Something is broken if it is even possible for the same to bait around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do. They won't prevent every incident, they won't save every life but we know what to do and it has not happened.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737421	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	Yes. What is broken is a political system that allows the NRA and other large big money to come in and make things not happen when the majority of people are for it. The people are with us now. After Parkland those students just didn't March, they talk to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family and they said there must be a better way. Then we elected people in the house of representatives and guess what? It changed and they passed universal background checks and now that bill is sitting on Mitch McConnell's doorstep because of the money and the power of the NRA. As president I will take them on.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737422	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	This is not about systems and words.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737423	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	how else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence? A number that no of their country comes even close to that we know what all of the solutions are and yet nothing has changed? It is because in this country money buys influence, access and increasingly outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place. As president we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of Congress or any candidate for federal office. We will listen to people, not packs, people not corporations, people not special interests.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737424	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	I think we have got to do--I think what I meant is what President Obama said in that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have a solution to the crisis. Now, I come from one of the most rural states in America. I have a D- voting record from the NRA, and as president, I suspect it will be an F record. What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA. You asked me about my record back in 1988 coming from a state that had no gun control. I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election. I will do everything I can not only to take on the NRA, but to expand and create universal background checks, do away with the straw man provision, do away with the gun show loophole, and do away with the loopholes now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737425	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Still the conversation that we've been having for the last 20 years. Of course we need to get money out of politics. But when I proposed the actual structural democratic reforms that might make a difference and the electoral college, amend the Constitution if necessary, to clear up Citizens United, have DC actually be a state and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform, people look at me funny as if this country were incapable of structural reform. Does anybody really think we're going to overtake Citizens United without constitutional action? This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737426	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	And you are telling me we can't reform our democracy--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737427	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--In our time?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737428	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--We have to or will be having the same argument 20 years from now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737429	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--So (INAUDIBLE)--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737430	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	I'd like to have a chance on this--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737431	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	I'd like to be part of this--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737432	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--I'd like to be heard on this--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737433	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	I'm saying that policies of this notion that you're going to take private insurance away from 180 million Americans who many of them don't want to give it--many of them do want to get rid of it but some don't. Many don't. Are you going to--the Green New Deal makes sure that every American is guaranteed a government job if they want. That is a disaster. You might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump. I think we got to focus on where Donald Trump is failing. You know, the word malpractice this is interesting I always thought of this as doctors or lawyers it's you know, (INAUDIBLE) proper illegal professional activity for doctors, lawyers or public officials. Google it. Check it out. Donald Trump is malpractice personified. We got to point that out why is it soybean farmers in--in Iowa need 10 good years to get back to where they were two years ago? Where is the manufacturing jobs that are supposed to come back? Why are we lurching from one international crisis to another? All things that he promised American voters. We got to focus on that and the economy and jobs and training so that we can promise a future for America that everybody wants to invest in.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737434	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, the truth is that every credible poll that I have seen has me beating Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737435	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Including--including the battleground states of Michigan where I won the democratic primary, Wisconsin, where I won the democratic primary and Pennsylvania. And the reason we are going to defeat Trump and beat him badly he is a fraud and a phony and we are going to expose him for what he is.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737436	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	The American people want to have a minimum wage which is a living wage, $15 bucks an hour.

737437	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--not the highest prices in the world--I've helped lead the effort for that as well.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737438	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	So again I--I think if you are going to force Americans to make these radical changes they are not going to go along--throw your hands up.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737440	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Oh wow I can do it. But you don't have to implement the plans. Us governors and mayors are the ones that we have to pick up all the pieces when suddenly the government is supposed to take over all these responsibilities and there's no preparation--the details on what you can't just spring a plan on the world an expect it to succeed.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737441	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	John, I was a mayor and I transformed my city. I have some practical experience. Second of all, interestingly enough today is the anniversary of Medicare. 54 years ago under Linda Johnson and a democratic congress they started a new program after one year--19 million elderly people in it. Please don't tell me that in a four year period we cannot go from 65 down to 55 to 45 to 35. This is not radical. This is what virtually every other country on earth does.

737444	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	And the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 countries. No matter how red or rural we did not write you off. No matter how blue or urban we did not take you for granted and we didn't trim our sales either. We had the courage of our convictions talking about universal healthcare, comprehensive immigration reform and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late.

737446	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	No. It is my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win. I took on giant banks and I beat them. I took on Wall Street and CEOs and their lobbyists and their lawyers and I beat them. I took on a popular republican incumbent senator and I beat him. I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn't get elected. Shoot, I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn't get elected, but here's where we are. I get it. There is a lot at stake and people are scared. But, we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else. And we can't ask other people to vote for a candidate we don't believe in. Democrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it. I am not afraid. And for democrats to win, you can't be afraid either.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

We have tried the solution of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. And what have the private insurance companies done? They've sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system. They've made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms. Why? Not because they're trying to track your healthcare. They just want one more excuse to say no.

737463	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	Everyone wants to get elected but my point is this I think when we have a guy in the White House that has now told over 10,000 lies that we had better be very straightforward with the American people. And no, do I think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of America off of their current insurance in four years? No, I don't think we are going to do that. I think there is a better way to get what we all want to see which is lower cost for healthcare. Do I think that we are going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids? No, I--I don't think we are going to do that. So that is what I am talking about but what I don't like about this argument right now--what I don't like about it at all is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election and I think--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737468	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	you know I think a big part of--of leadership in showing our commitment to the American people is delivering on our commitments. As a member of Congress when I learned that the El Paso VA had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country meaning that care delayed functionally became care tonight and was related to the suicide epidemic, we made it our priority and we turned around the VA in El Paso. We took that lesson nationally and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand mental health care to veterans and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing, Donald Trump, to show at the end of the day we will put the American people first--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

It puts every living thing on this planet at risk. I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best and that is innovate and create. So I have proposed putting $2 trillion in so we do the research. We then say anyone in the world can use it so long as you build it right here in America. That will produce about 1.2 million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan, right here in Ohio, right here in the industrial Midwest.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

It's a distraction. I share the urgency of everyone appear. We have to recognize, I mean, everyone's got good ideas. What we do in this country is no better than just a best practice, right? It's what we do here is a--is a best practice and a template, but it's got to be done all over the world.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737476	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	So we've got to be building bridges right now with people like China who were cheating on international agreements and stealing intellectual property. We need to work on that, but not with the tariff system. We need every country working together if we're going to really deal with climate change in a realistic way.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737477	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Well, I put a real policy on the table to create 1.2 million new jobs and in green manufacturing. There's going to be a $23 trillion worldwide market for this. This could revitalize huge cities across this country, and no one wants to talk about it.

And we won't meet that challenge with half steps or half measures or only half the country. We got to bring everyone in. The people of Detroit and those that I listened to in Flint last week--they want the challenge. They want those jobs. They want to create the future for this country and the world. Those community college students I met in Tucumcari, New Mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest growing jobs in the country and those farmers in Iowa say pay me for the environmental services of planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements. That's how we meet the challenge. We do it with everyone in this country. We bring everyone into the solution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

I think the governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan fix the damn roads and it is an issue for union jobs and so I think what we need to do is not have a precedent that has promised he was going to do that on election night if anyone reads members and then he hasn't followed through. He has done nothing. He blew up the meeting at the White House. I would put $1 trillion into the sand I would pay for it by first of all changing the capital gains rate, by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer as he promised and I would take that money and put it into rural broadband and green infrastructure so you won't have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson-Chalmers neighborhood, the African neighborhood that was African-American neighborhood that was most hit when you had those recent rainstorms.

It doesn't just offend our sensibilities to hear him say send her back about a member of Congress because she's a woman of color, because she's a Muslim American. Doesn't just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants rapist and criminals or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over or from every tradition of faith. It is also changing this country. Hate crimes are on the rise every single one of the last three years.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

That is what we have learned in El Paso, Texas, my hometown, one of the safest cities in the United States of America not despite but because it is a city of immigrants and asylum seekers and refugees.

737499	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Well the core value behind this entire country's history is working towards a more perfect union, that all people are created equal and we have fallen far away from that. I think the job is incumbent on any one of us to make the convincing case that we can deliver an urban agenda that represents progress in schools. You know Colorado when I was mayor we got to universal pre-K for every kid in the urban city. We did major police reform 10 years before Ferguson. Why is it now that five years after Ferguson we still don't have anything? How do we get affordable housing? We create a scholarship fund for every kid. You've got to deliver a vision like that for the whole country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

So, I have a plan, for example, on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids, but we've got to acknowledge what's happened on race. So, my plan have universal tuition free college for all of our kids, but also increases the Pell Grant and levels the playing field by putting $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.

737506	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	As an urban mayor serving a diverse community, the racial divide lives within me. I'm not saying that I became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch. But, in our city, we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing and so, we directed it to a high--historically underinvested African American neighborhood. Right now, in the wake of a police-involved shooting, our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use of force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters.

737507	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	I proposed a Douglas Plan to tackle this issue nationally because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action. Systemic racism has touched every part of American life, from housing to health, to home ownership. If you walk into an emergency room and you are black, your reports of pain will be taken less seriously. If you apply for a job and you are black, you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume.

They just wanted a better shake in the economy. And so, I would appeal to them. But, I don't think anyone can justify what this president is doing. Little kids literally woke up this weekend, turned on the TV and saw their president calling their city, the town of Baltimore, nothing more than a home for rats. And I can tell you, as your president, that will stop. The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country. I know that because I have lived it. And that means when we put out there better childcare and better education and we pay teachers more and we make sure there's a decent retirement system in place. Yes, we help the African American community and we must because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what we've seen in the last decade, but we help everyone.

737514	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	The legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crowe and suppression is alive and well in every aspect of the economy and in the country today. As president, I will sign into law a new voting rights act. I will focus on education, address healthcare disparities, but I will also sign into law Sheila Jackson Lee's reparations bill so that we can have	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737515	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	the national conversation we have waited too long in this country to have.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737516	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, I responded to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn's legislation, which is called 10-20-30. And with what that understands is that as a result of slavery and segregation and the institutional racism we see now in healthcare, in education, in financial services, we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African-American communities. In terms of education, I also have a plan. It's called the Thurgood Marshall plan and it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America. It would triple funding for title I schools, it would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $60,000 a year.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737517	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	For decades we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant, multinational corporations to help giant multinational corporations. They have no loyalty to America. They have no patriotism. If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico they'll do it in a heartbeat. If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam they'll do it in a heartbeat. I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says, when are we going to do it that way? We are going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table, with small businesses at the table, with small farmers at the table, with environmentalists at the table. With human rights activists at the table. And then, we are going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to America's markets. They want to sell to you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737518	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	It's--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737519	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	If everyone wants to get to America's markets. No.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737520	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	So the question is--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737521	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	We need to raise our standards.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737522	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Oh, I'm sorry.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737523	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	What the congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by American workers for American workers. American workers want those jobs. And we can build the trade deals that do it. People want access to our markets all around the world. Then the answer is let's make them raise their standards. Make them pay their workers more. Let their workers unionize. Raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they want to be able to sell their products. Right now, the whole--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737524	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	working for the big multinationals. It's just not working for the people here in the United States.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737525	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	and we can change that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737526	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	You know the--the question was about tariffs and they are a huge mistake. They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences. When have we ever gone to war including a trade war without allies and friends and partners? As president we will hold China accountable or we will bring our allies and friends like the European Union to bear and we will also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and American workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor, not just here in the United States--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737527	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	but in those (INAUDIBLE).	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737528	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	I just want to respond to this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737529	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Okay. You are looking I believe that the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA, PM. TR (PH) with China which cost us over 4 million jobs but also helped lead the effort against these agreements.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737530	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Now Elizabeth is absolutely right, if anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker you are mistaken. If they can save five cents--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737531	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--by going to China, Mexico or Vietnam or anyplace else that is exactly what they would do. As president let me tell you what I will do. These guys line up at the federal trough. They want military contracts, they want all kinds of contracts. Well, under my administration you ain't going to get those contracts if you are throwing American workers--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737532	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--out on the street.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737533	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	So I think again I think Congressman Delaney has got a point here and there is a way of looking at--at trade that is therapeutic. The bottom line is you talk to any economist, there is not a single example in history where a trade war had a winner. Trade wars are for losers and the bottom line is we have got to recognize let's negotiate a better trade deal but you are not going to win against China in a trade war when they've got 25% of our total debt. And step back and look at here Trump gives that giant tax cut and at the same time so we are paying in tariffs about $800-$1200 per household and then we give this incredible tax cut to the rich. Essentially what is happening is now he has transferred that tax obligation on to the middle class. That is what's outrageous but tariffs are not the solution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737534	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn't understand what's going on. Look at the new NAFTA 2.0. What's the central feature? It is to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians, Americans and Mexicans more money and make more profits. That is what trade deals have become. They have become a way for giant multinationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind. We have to have the courage to fight back against that corruption.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737535	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Don, can I say something--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737536	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	What just happened in my community 20 years before I was born and when I was growing up we were still picking up the pieces. Empty factories, empty houses, poverty. I know exactly what happens to a community when these closures take place and there will be more. It is why we actually need to put the interest of workers first. Of course we need to do retraining. We are doing it now in South Bend. We should continue to do it but this is so much bigger than a trade fight. This is about a moment when the economy is changing before our eyes. There are people in the gig economy who go through more jobs in a week then my parents went through in their lifetime. It is why I have propose that we allow	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737537	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--Workers to unionize because a gig is a job and a worker is a worker.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737538	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	We have to respond to all of these changes and, you know, in addition to confronting tech, in addition to supporting workers by doubling unionization, as I proposed to do--some of this is low-tech to like the minimum wage is just too low. And so-called conservative Christian senators right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage when Scripture says that whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737539	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	So I have proposed a wealth tax. It's now time to do that. It's time to tax the top one tenth of 1 percent of fortunes in this country. Your first $50 million, you can keep free and clear, but your 50 millionth and first dollar you've got to pitch in two cents. Two cents. What can America do with two cents? We can provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five. We can provide universal child--a pre-k for every three-year-old and four-year-old. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. We can provide universal tuition free college. We can expand Pell, we can put $50 billion into our historically black colleges and universities, and we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it and start to close the wealth gap in America. It tells you how badly broken this economy is--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737540	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--That two cents from the wealthiest in this country--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737541	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--Would let us invest in the rest of America--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737542	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	--This is my proposal--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737543	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	--Could I--could I just respond to that, please?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737544	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	I'd like to respond to this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737545	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	That would be great for us and then the next day, there would be a student loan program and people would be out taking student loans wondering they weren't--why they weren't lucky enough in timing to get theirs right away completely too. We can have debt free college for low and middle income students by expanding Pell grants and compelling states to pick up more of the burden. And on the backend, for those of us who do have a lot of debt, we can make it more affordable and we can expand a public service loan forgiveness program, which is an excellent program that is almost impossible to actually get access to right now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737546	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	We can take these steps and have an approach that is actually fair. If we want to start wiping away student debt, here's where I would start. I would start with the for-profit colleges that took advantage of people, especially veterans, by the way. The moment I redeployed, my Facebook add feed started filling with ads from these for-profit colleges. Under President Obama, they were held accountable for whether they deliver results. President Obama--President Trump, under a Secretary of Education--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737547	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	--who, regrettably, is from this state did away with those rules. There's no accountability. On my watch, those colleges that turn the Department of Education into a predatory lender, that's where we would begin when it came to getting rid of loans.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737548	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Matter of fact, I do. But, before I get into that, the major issue that we don't talk about in Congress, you don't talk about in the media is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America. You got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. You got top 1 percent that owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent. Forty-nine percent of all the income goes to the top 1 percent. Companies like Amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax and we've got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737549	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	What we need is a political revolution that tells these billionaires and corporate America that they are Americans, they'll participate in our society, but they have got to start paying their fair share of taxes, period.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737550	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	I support free two year college. Earn that associate's degree, realize your full potential, debt free four year college. But, unlike some of other candidates on the stage, that's not just for tuition, that is room and books and board, the full cost of being able to better yourselves so that you can better this country. And then for that school teacher, who in many places like Texas, is working a second or a third job, full forgiveness for her outstanding student loan debt. Forgiveness for that person willing to work at the VA and serve our former service members. And we do not do that at the expense of unions. We elevate them as well and make it easier to join an apprenticeship to learn a skill or a trade that you can command for the rest of your life.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737551	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	I want to make it easier for kids to go to college and I think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most. And my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids, for Wall Street kids to go to college. There's no difference. It says everyone is free. I don't think that makes sense. And I am very concerned if we do things like that, the debt we're going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation. So, what I would do about student loan debt is that I would allow people to refinance it at a better rate and I would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them so that you literally over five, 10 years can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we don't have enough workers. I think we need to mesh what we were just talking about with the economy--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

We have spent $5 trillion on the war on terror and there are probably more terrorists out there now than before it began. We're going to spend--Congress passed and I will not vote for a $715 billion military budget--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737555	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	more than the ten men--ten best countries combined. What we need is a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy. Ending conflicts by people sitting at a table not by killing each other. As president of the United States I will go to the u--the United Nations and not denigrate it, not attack the UN but bring countries together in the Middle East and all over the world to come to terms with their differences and solve those problems peacefully.

737557	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Well, we share the recognition of the incredible cost. People don't realize that half the soldiers that fought in Iraq and Afghanistan are National Guard. So, I went and sent them off on their deployments big you know, noisy hangers ho are also (INAUDIBLE) mourn with their families when they didn't come back. We are able now to I call it constant engagement. But we should have an international diplomatic approach where we are talking to everybody. Because if we're going to deal with climate change and cybersecurity and nuclear proliferation we are going to be talking to everybody. (INAUDIBLE) don't work.

737559	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	I think we agree. I just think you have to leave open the possibility of meeting with anyone at any place. What I don't like is how this president has handled it. You've heard of the Truman Doctrine, the Manuel Doctrine. He's done the go it alone doctrine with the rest of the world. He's taken us out of the climate change agreement, out of the Iran nuclear agreement, out of the Russian nuclear agreement and I don't agree with that. And when he was just with Vladimir Putin at the G20 when he was asked about invading our democracy he made a joke--hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote. Four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama lost their life in a church at the height of the civil rights amendment. So, I do believe you meet with people but you better have an agenda.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737560	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	And you better put our interests of our country first. Not the Russians.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

737562	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	Yes. But around the world we will do whatever it takes to keep America safe. But I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan. When I thought I was turning out the lights years ago. Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan I think about what it was like to hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with--somebody that I knew, a friend, roommate, colleague. We're pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on 9/11. I was sent into that war by a congressional authorization as well as a president. And we need to talk not only about the need for president committed to ending endless wars. But the fact that congress has been asleep on the switch. And on my watch I will propose that any authorization	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN

We have satisfied the reasons for our involvement in Afghanistan in the first place and it is time to bring those servicemembers back home from Afghanistan but also from Iraq, also from Yemen and Somalia and Libya and Syria. There is no reason for us to be at work all over the world tonight.

Our military is the best on earth but we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution.

That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk right in the middle of this. At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world has pulled us out of the deal in neuron and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon.

737580	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	I don't care how old you are. I care about your vision. But I do think it matters that we have a new generation of leaders stepping up around the world. Leaders like the--I actually think it's good that the Prime Minister of New Zealand has gotten a lot of attention in democratic debates. She's masterful. She is younger than I would be when I take office. This is the kind of trend America might be leading instead of following, but only if it's actually backed by the right vision and we can have great presidents at any age.

737581	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	What I will say is we need the kind of vision that's going to win. We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal. The only reason we got this president is that normal didn't work. We have to be ready to take on this president and, by the way, something that hasn't been talked about as much tonight, take on his enablers and in Congress. You know, when--when David Duke--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737582	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	When David Duke ran for Congress, ran for governor, the Republican Party 20 years ago ran away from him. Today, they are supporting naked racism in the White House, or at best, silent about it. And if you are watching this at home and you are a Republican member of Congress, consider the fact that when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story of all the good and bad things you did in your life, the thing you will be remembered for is whether in this moment with this president, you found the courage to stand up to him or you continued to put party over country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737583	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Well, Pete is right. It's a question of vision. That's what it is, whether you're young, whether you're old, whether you are in between. And my vision, among other things, says that if we're going to fight for healthcare, we don't take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies. And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who, in my view, are going to war against the American people in terms of healthcare. That's a new vision. A new vision says that we must cancel completely student that because the younger generation in this country today, for the first time in modern American history, will have a lower standard of living than their parents.

737584	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	I'd like to respond on this too--	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737585	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	Thank you and what a night. I loved it. I'd like to ask every American to imagine that you are facing life threatening surgery tomorrow. Would you choose a doctor that had a track record with proven success who had actually done the work? Or someone who just talked about it? That's the question we are facing in this primary. I've actually got track record as a small business owner and as a mayor and as a governor. We expanded healthcare in Colorado. We've got near universal coverage. We fought climate change directly. We beat the NRA. And for the last three years we have been the number one economy in the country. We can map all that out.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737586	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	John Hickenlooper	2019-07-30	I'm as progressive as anybody up on this stage but I'm also pragmatic. And I have done the things that most of these other people are just talking about and I know I can get results. And I can lead the people of this country toward a stronger, a healthier and a more secure future and defeat Donald Trump and return this country to its glory. Thank you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737587	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Amy Klobuchar	2019-07-30	Thank you, Detroit. To win we have to listen to people. And out there today is Casey Joe's mom. Casey Joe was a champion high school swimmer form a small town. She got sick. Went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids. The last thing that she said to her mom was momma it's not our fault and she died. A lot of Americans say the same thing every day and that is what I will stand up for and what I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didn't tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen we need someone that has people's back. We also need someone that can win. And I have won in these red districts. I win in the Midwest. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Michigan and Iowa. I also will do my job without fear or favor just like I did as a prosecutor and get through the gridlock like I've done as a senator where I've passed over 100 bills where I've been the lead democrat. And last, yes, I will govern with integrity. We have the President where people turn off their TV when they see him. Not me. I will make you proud as your president.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737588	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Beto O'Rourke	2019-07-30	We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been. And right now, we have a president who uses fear to try to drive us further apart. To meet this challenge we have to have hope in one another and a faith in the future of this country that includes everyone. My whole life I've been including people in the success of this country. Starting a small business with high value, high wage, high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban country in America. Serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day. And in congress being in the minority but working with democrats and republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country. And then in Texas this last year--traveling to every country. Not writing anybody off. Not taking anyone for granted. And at the end of the day winning more votes than any democrat had in the history of the state. Winning independence for the first time in decades and winning nearly half a million republicans. And those 38 electoral college votes in Texas are now in play and I can win them. That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021. Thank you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737589	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Pete Buttigieg	2019-07-30	There's good news and bad news. I'm going to start with the bad news--our country is in trouble. GDP is going up and life expectancy is going down. Think about what that means. It is only getting tougher. By 2030 we will have passed the point of no return on climate. There will be 130 million more guns on our streets. I'll be in my 40s then. If you have kids--think about how old they will be then. But here's the good news--it's not too late. We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time--just before we ran out of time in 2020 we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn't have to wonder if it could support us. To deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcements. That we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats. We can do this if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn't worked with bold action and win--not only defeat this president but defeat as congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican party with its conscience as well as bringing democrats to office. Join me and let's make it happen.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737590	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	From the time I was seven years old I had a dream, I wanted to be a public school teacher. But my daddy ended up as a janitor and by the time I graduated from high school my family didn't have the money to send me off to college. My big chance was what was then a commuter college that cost $50 a semester. For me what this election is all about is opportunity. Every budget, every policy that we talk about is a about who is going to get opportunity. Is it going to go to the billionaires or is it going to go to our kids?	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737591	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Elizabeth Warren	2019-07-30	Right now for decades we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful. It has been on the side of the wealthy and that means it has not been on the side of everyone else. Not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, people living in small farms and small communities across this country. How do we beat it? We beat it by being the party of big structural change. Give people a reason to show up and vote and we beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country, not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires but actually building it person by person across this country with small dollar donations, with volunteers, with people who show up and say I have a stake in this democracy. I will not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, I will start to make real change come 2021.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737592	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	As somebody who grew up in a family that lived in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York and live paycheck to paycheck I am running for president not just to do be the most dangerous president in the history of this country, a guy who is a racist and a sexist and a homophobe. I am running to transform this country and to stand with the working class of America which for the last 45 years has been decimated.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737593	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	Two days ago I had a remarkable experience which should tell you everything you need to know about what is going on in America. I took 15 people with diabetes from Detroit a few miles into Canada and we bought insulin for one-tenth the price being charged by the crooks who run the pharmaceutical industry in America today.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737594	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	But it's not just the price fixing and the corruption and the greed of the pharmaceutical--(INAUDIBLE), it is what is going on in the fossil fuel industry. It's what is going on in Wall Street. It is what is going on with the prison industrial complex.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
737595	CNN HOSTS 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DETROIT, NIGHT 1	Bernie Sanders	2019-07-30	We need a mass political movement. Please go to BernieSanders.com, become one of our million volunteers. Stand up and take on the greed and corruption of the ruling class of this country. Let's create a government and an economy that works for all of us, not just for one person.	Democratic Presidential Debate - July 30 | CNN
