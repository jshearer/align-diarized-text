1101981	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Good evening. (UNTRANSLATED) Welcome to Texas. It's great to be here at TSU, home of the Tigers. You know on January 20, 2021 at 12:01 PM we are going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101982	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	There will be life after Donald Trump but the truth is that our problems didn't start just with Donald Trump and we won't solve them by embracing old ideas. We need a bold vision, universal pre-K and universal healthcare; unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy; a tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101983	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	But first we have to win and that means exciting a young, diverse coalition of Americans who are ready for a bold future. That is what Kennedy did, it is like Carter did, it is what Clinton did, it is what Barack Obama did and it is what I can do in this race, get back Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia and Arizona and finally turn Texas blue and say goodbye to Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101984	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Good evening Texas Southern. I believe that what unites us up here the 10 of us is much stronger than what divides us and I think that's true of our country, too.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101985	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Now I may not be the loudest person up here but I think we've already got that in the White House. Houston--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101986	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	--we have a problem. This-- we have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101987	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change. And leading the world in taking on climate change. Look, this is the United States of America. There has never been a single, solitary time that we set our minds on something we are unable to do it. We are walking with our heads down like whoa is me. We are the best equipped nation in the world to take this on. It's no longer time to postpone--we should get moving. There's enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101988	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	That will be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think--I think we should have a debate on healthcare. I think I know that the Senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that's been cut, add a public option--guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101989	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for healthcare costs a lot of money--it costs $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion. $3.4 trillion a year it turns out is twice what the entire federal budget is. That's before it exists now without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that's happening. Such far, my distinguished friends the Senator on my left is not--has not indicated how she pays for it and the Senator has, in fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it but it gets him about halfway there.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101990	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	There's a lot of other things that need to be done. I drive a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools that are Title 1 schools from 40 from 15 to $40 billion a year. But I go down the line and each of the things we are talking about I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done and why it's better.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101991	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So, let's be clear about healthcare and let's actually start where Vice President did--we all owe huge debt to President Obama who fundamentally transformed healthcare in America and committed this country to healthcare for every human being.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101992	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	And now, the question is how best can we improve on it? And I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by healthcare at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it those at the very top--the richest individuals and the biggest corporations are going to pay more. And middle class families are going to pay less. That's how this is going to work.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101993	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Look, what families have to deal with is cost. Total cost. That's what they have to deal with and understand, families are paying for their healthcare today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry you can't see that specialist. Every time an insurance company say sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry, we are not covering that prescription. Families are paying every time they don't get a prescription filled because they can't pay for it. They don't have a lump checked out because they can't afford the copay. What we're talking about here is what is going to happen in families' pockets--what's going to happen in their budgets. And the answer is on Medicare for all--costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101994	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	But for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down and--and that's how it should work under Medicare for all in our healthcare (INAUDIBLE).	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101995	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Joe said that Medicare for All would cost over $30 trillion. That's right, Joe. Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing healthcare to every man, woman and child in this country. I wrote the damn bill if I may say so--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101996	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	--intent to eliminate all out of pocket expenses all deductibles, all copayments, nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs because we are going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101997	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	We need--we need a healthcare system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies and to tell you how absurd the system is 10 nine on ABC the healthcare industry will be advertising telling you how bed Medicare for All is because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101998	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	If I could respond? George?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1101999	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Okay. Number one, my health care plan does significantly cut the cost of the largest out of pocket payment you will pay is $1000. You will be get into a--anyone that can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in a--in--in the Medicare type option we have, etc. But guess what of the 160 million people who like their healthcare now they can keep it. If they don't like it they can leave, number one.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102000	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two, the fact of the matter is we are in a situation where if you notice he hasn't answered the question. This is about candor, honesty, big ideas.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102001	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Let's have a big idea. The tax of 2 percent that the senator is talking about that raises about $3 billion. Guess what? That leaves you about $28 billion short. The senator said before it's going to cost you in your pay--there will be a deductible in your paycheck. The middle class person someone making $60,000 with three kids they are going to end up paying $5000 more, they are going to end up paying 4 percent more on their income taxes. That's reality. Now that's not a bad idea if you like it. I don't like it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102002	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Sure. That's good.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102003	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So let's be clear I--I have actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company. I have met people who like their doctors--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102004	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	--I have met people who like their nurses, I have met people who like their pharmacist. I have met people who like their physical therapist. What they want is access to health care and we just need to be clear about what Medicare for All is all about. Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage we are going to do this by saying everyone is covered by Medicare for All, every health care provider is covered. And the only question here in terms of differences where to send the bill.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102005	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Let us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as the Canadians or any other major country on earth.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102006	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	This is a America.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102007	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Yeah, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries and they guarantee health care to all people. Under my Medicare for All proposal when you don't pay out-of-pocket and you don't pay premiums may be you run into people who love their premiums. I haven't. What people want is cost-effective health care, Medicare for All will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102008	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I think you know that I don't agree with some of these proposals appear, George. So I'm talking about--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102009	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	If I could--if I could respond to some of the proposals from my friends. First of all Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals. That was a Klobuchar-Sanders Amendment to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada. We have work to bring down the cost by fighting to allow 43 million seniors, that is a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare. I figured that's a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102010	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	But it when it comes to our health care and when it comes to our premiums I go with the doctor's creed which is due no harm and while Bernie wrote the bill I read the bill and on page 8--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102011	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	--on page 8 of the bill it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it and that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance in four years.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102012	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea. And what I favor--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102013	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, and that is a public option, a nonprofit choice that would bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people, and bring down the prices for 13 more million more people. That is a bold idea.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102014	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I'm sorry.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102015	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	STEPHANOPOULOS She said page 8 of the bill, 149 people will lose their health insurance.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102016	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Current health insurance.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102017	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	149 million.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102018	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So let's be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals, doctors won't have to hire people to fill out crazy forms. They won't have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies. People who have sick family members won't have to get into these battles. What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for healthcare for everyone in this country. Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your health care coverage.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102019	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote and that Senator Warren backed--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102020	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	is that it doesn't trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102021	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Not my way or the highway. Now look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with ACA. I propose Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we are right, as progressives that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don't you?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102022	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	George, you talk about was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs, or they go unemployed, or their employer changes their insurance policy. Medicare for all is comprehensive healthcare, covers all basic needs, including home healthcare. It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not. So if you want comprehensive healthcare, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for all is the way to go.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102023	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far. We would not be here if he hadn't the courage, the talent, or the will to see us this far.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102024	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie. You know, you brought us this far in Medicare for all. I support Medicare for all. I always have, but I wanted to make the plan better, which I did, which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them. So under my Medicare for all plan, people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan because that's what people want.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102025	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And I agree we shouldn't take choice from people, but here's the thing. Everybody on this stage, I do believe, is well-intentioned and once that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don't have coverage. But at least five people have talked some repeatedly on the subject and not once have we talked about Donald Trump. So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the affordable care act. We all fought against it and then that late great John McCain at that moment at about 2:00 in the morning killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102026	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Fast-forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump's Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the affordable care act. Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of ban that we placed on denying people who have pre-existing conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans. And frankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they are going to have healthcare and cost will not be a barrier to getting it. But let's focus on the end goal. If we don't get Donald Trump out of office, he's going to get rid of all of it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102027	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Fifteen seconds.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102028	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Fifteen seconds. Look, everybody says you want an option. The option I'm proposing is a Medicare for All and a Medicare for Choice. If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance--from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You don't have--no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered period.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102029	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	And if you notice, nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this large savings. The president thinks--my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer is going to give you back it if you negotiated as union all of these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They are going to give the back that money to the employee?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102030	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Matter of fact, they will under our bill.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102031	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Well, let me tell you something. For socialist, you've got a--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102032	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--For a socialist, you've got a lot more confidence in corporate America that I do.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102033	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Okay.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102034	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	One minute, George.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102035	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	All right, two points.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102036	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Yep.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102037	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	You gotta defend the fact that today not only do we have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you gotta defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they're going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease, cancer or heart disease. Under my legislation, people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer. And our program is the only one that does that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102038	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I know a lot about cancer. Let me tell you something.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102039	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	It's personal to me. Let me tell you something. Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately. And we're talking four, six, eight, 10 years depending on who you talk about before we get to Medicare for All. Come on. I've been there. You've been there. You know what it's like. People need help now, hope now, and do something now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102040	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Yeah.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102041	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Thank you. Listen, I'm grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections of that we have right now. But I also think were being offered a false choice between those who propose an all or nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like that works for them to force them on to Medicare, and others who want to, as the vice president does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions, uninsured and uncared for. In a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, we've got to do better.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102042	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	And my proposal, Medicare for America, says everyone who's uninsured will be enrolled in a Medicare. Everyone who's insufficiently uninsured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare. And of those, like members of unions, who fought for the healthcare plans that work for them and their families are able to keep them up.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102043	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	--That is the best possible path forward.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102044	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--You just described my plan--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102045	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Thank you. And, you know, I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this. And of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barack Obama.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102046	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered. Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn't true when Senator Harris brought that up. There was a--a fact check of that and they said that was true.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102047	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	You know, I grew up with a grandmother who had type II diabetes, and I watched her condition get worse and worse. But that whole time, she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available. If they choose to hold on to strong, solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102048	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. They would have to buy in. That's a big difference, because Barack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102085	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Yeah.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102086	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	But a house divided cannot stand.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102088	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Look, everyone, we know we're on the same team. We know we're on the same team. We all have a better vision for healthcare than our current president. And I believe we're talking about this the wrong way.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102089	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	As someone who has run a business, I know that our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. You instead pretend to their contractors. It's hard to change jobs. It's certainly harder to start a business. The pitch we have to make to the American people is we will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102090	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentives so, instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the healthcare system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102091	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	In the Cleveland clinic, where they are paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe, shocker, they prescribe fewer procedures and patient health stays the same or improves.

1102092	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Thank you very much. Look, there are--there are a lot of people watching at home right now listening to us that are afraid because they are in crisis. They don't have health insurance. Their health insurance doesn't go far enough. They can't afford their prescription drugs. Look, I--I'm clear in what I believe. I believe in Medicare for All. I believe it's the best way to rationalize the system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102093	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	But, dear God, I know that every one of my colleagues on the stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions. And I'll tell you, there is an urgency right now in this nation. Everybody feels it. As a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice-	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102094	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Progress on the altar of purity because people in my community they need help right now. They have high blood pressure right now. They have unaffordable insulin right now and this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground but find common ground because we have got one shot to make Donald Trump a one term president--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102095	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--and we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other or demonize and to greet each other. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. If I am the leader, I will work toward the idea of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans. But every single day I will join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102096	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	you know, I called the sound in no uncertain terms on August 3 and every day since then and I was talking about it long before then as well. Racism in America is endemic, it is foundational. We can mark the creation of is not at 4 July 1776 but August 20, 1619 when the first kidnapped African--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102097	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	--was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave built the greatness and the success and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy. We have to be able to answer this challenge and it is found in our education system where in Texas a five-year-old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended or expelled based on the color of their skin. In our healthcare system--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102098	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	--where there is a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color or the fact that there's 10 times the wealth in white America than there is in black America. I'm going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee's lead and sign into law a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundations.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102099	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102100	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of El Paso. He has done a great job with that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102101	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Look, a few weeks ago a shooter drove 10 miles inspired by this--10 hours inspired by this President to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family. White supremacy is a growing threat to this country and we have to rooted out. I am proud that I put forward a plan to disarm hate. I'm also proud that I was the first to put forward a police reform plan because we are not going to have any more (INAUDIBLE) McDonald(SP) or Eric Garner or--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102102	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--or Michael Brown or Pamela Turner's or Walter Scott's or Sandra Bland here from the Houston area. We need to root out racism and I believe that we can do that because that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart. They also need a leader to match that and I will be a president that matches that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102103	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Well, first and foremost I want to hit that point because we know Donald Trump is a racist but there is no red badge of courage were calling him that. Racism exist the question isn't who--who isn't a racist, it is who is and isn't doing something about racism. And this is not just an issue that started yesterday, it is not just an issue that we hear a president that can't condemn white supremacy. We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation from health care to the criminal justice system and it's nice to go all the way back to slavery but dear God we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102104	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--today than all of the slaves in 1850. We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out and having the plan to do something about it. If I am president of the United States we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes and we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans from criminal justice reform to the disparities in healthcare to even one that we don't talk about enough which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice and communities of color all around this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102105	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I think what has deepen divisions in the country is the conduct of this president and we have a chance to change all of that. Look, systemic racism preceded this president and even when we defeat him it will be with us. That is why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it. It--it's not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own. Harms (INAUDIBLE) in the same way that eight dollars saved (INAUDIBLE), so does a dollar stolen and we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts us in two different countries.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102106	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe but this time a Douglas Plan that we invest right here at home to make sure that we are not only dealing with things like the over incarceration of black Americans but also black solutions, entrepreneurship, raising to 25 percent the target for the federal government to do business with minority owned businesses; investing in HBCUs that are training and education the next generation of entrepreneurs.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102107	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We can and must do that but that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced auto worker because when I come--where I come from a lot of times that displaced auto worker is a single black mother of three. We have got to say that I bring people together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102108	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	So there have been--there have been--I am glad you asked me this question and there have been many distortions of my record. Let me be very clear I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons. One, I have always wanted to protect people and keep them safe and second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102109	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had. But I've made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try and do it from the inside. And so I took on the position that allowed me without asking permission to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and become a national model around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs. I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time. I created one of the first in the nation trainings for police officer on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102110	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Was I able to get enough done? Absolutely not. But my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit reasons on day one. It will be--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102111	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	About what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable. And finally, my plan is about making sure that in America's criminal justice system, we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement, and that we work on keeping families intact. And as president of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this done job complete.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102112	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	That's not my record. We are here at eight historically black college and I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan in something that she once said. She said that the people want is simple. They want a country as good as it promise. And that same can be said of the criminal justice system. So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis. But in the prosecutor's office, they were handled with a grand jury. That's how they were all handled across our state.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102113	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself. That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did. 400 people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids. There was a kid named Byron Phillips (SP) that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it. When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups, we put up billboards, we found the shooter, and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a literal girl named Taisha Edwards (SP) who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102114	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	What changes did we make, go after white-collar crime in a big way. Diversify the office in a big way. Work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID. And as a senator and as your president, I will make sure that we don't just do the first step act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the second step act, which means that 90 percent of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let's reduce those sentences for nonviolent offenders and let's get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102115	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Well, first of all, let me say that when I came back from law school, I had a job with great--a big-time law firm and left and became a public defender because my state was under siege. When Doctor King was assassinated, we were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months. I've been involved from the beginning. As a young congressman--as a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in the poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining. Banks should have to lend where they operated, et cetera.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102116	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we are in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime. As--when we are in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation--we build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102117	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	We--I'm the guy that put in the--the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. And so we have to change the whole way we look at this. When we put people in prison, we have to equip them when they get out. Nobody who got in prison for marijuana, for example, immediately upon being released, they shouldn't be in there for a--a Mr.--that should be a misdemeanor. They should be out, and their record should be expunged.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102118	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Every single right should be your term. When you finish your term in prison you should be able to not only vote but have access to Pell Grants, have access to be able to get housing, have access to be able to move along the way.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102119	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I've laid out a detailed plan along those lines. And the fact is we've learned so much more--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102120	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken. There's no difference in America between blacks, whites and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs. But if you're African American you're almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated destroying your lives. And so much of this comes down to privilege. We have a criminal justice system that Brian Stephenson says treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. And so, I have challenged this whole field--we can specifically and demonstratedly now show that there are 17,000 people unjustly incarcerated in America and all of us should come forward and say when we are president of the United States, when I am president of the United States we will release them.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102121	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And let me be specific--I--I joined tighter and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill passed under this president for criminal justice reform that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail. If 87 members of the United States senate says that these sentences are way too long and we changed it, but we didn't make it retroactive we can literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now. Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17,000 people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102122	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And, I challenge you. Don't just say big statements. Back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation--which is liberty and freedom. We need to reform the system and we must do it now. Every day that we wait--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102123	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--is too long.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102124	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Because we got it done before--I'm the only one up here who has ever beat the NRA. Only one that ever beat the NRA nationally. I'm the guy that brought the Brady Bill and the--and the--into focus and became law. And so, that's number one.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102125	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two, after Sandy Hook a number of things happened. This went form a cause to a movement. Look what's happened now--Mothers--the organization, Mothers Against Violence this in--gun violence. We've seen what's happened again. Now, we have all these young people marching on Washington making sure that things are going to change. There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the President had over 50 percent of--of gun--of gun--for members of the NRA supporting them and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102126	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Now, the numbers are much higher because they realize what I've been saying and we've all been saying is correct. Over 90 percent of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street. Period. And we have to get buy backs and get them out of their basements.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102127	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	So, the point is--things have changed and things have changed a lot. And now, what's happening is--and by the way, the way Beto handled--excuse me, for saying Beto, Congressman.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102128	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	It's all right. Beto is good.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102129	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	The way he handled what happened in his hometown is--the look in the eyes of those people to see those kids, to understand those parents--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102130	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--to understand the heartache. We are ready to do this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102131	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Thank you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102132	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	That's right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102133	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Some things you can. Many things you can't.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102134	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I mean I would just say hey, Joe, instead of saying on, we can't let's say yes, we can. (LAUGHTER)	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102135	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Let's be constitutional. Got a constitution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102136	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Yes, we can because I'll tell you something--the way that I think about this is I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102137	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I have attended more police officer funerals than like care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you and the idea that we would wait for this Congress which has just done nothing to act is just it is--it is overlooking the fact that every day in America our babies are going to school to have drills elementary, middle, and high school students where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102138	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I was talking about this at one of my town halls and--and--and this child was eight years old probably came up to me it was like it was a secret between the two of us and he tugged on my jacket and he said I had to have one of those drills. It is traumatizing our children. El Paso and, Beto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102139	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	You know people ask me and El Paso they said because I have a long-standing record on this issue they said well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened. I said well, look, I mean obviously he didn't pull the trigger but he has certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102140	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	What I said was the question speak to constitutional scholars. If in fact we could say by the way you can't own the following weapons, they cannot be sold anymore. Check with constitutional scholars. Now you can say--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102141	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Could I tell you what you could do--respond	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102142	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	I am if it is a weapon that was designed to kill people--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102143	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	--on a battlefield; if they high impact high velocity round when it hits your body shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers. When we see that being used against children and in Odessa I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell yes we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102144	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	We are not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102145	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	I want to say this I am listening to the people of this country the day after I propose doing that I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas to meet with those who are selling AR-15 and AK-47s and those who are buying those weapons. And you might be surprised there was some common ground there. Folks who said I would willing give that up, cut it to pieces I don't need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war. So let's do the right thing but let's bring everyone in America into the conversation Republicans, Democrats, gunowners and non-gunowners alike.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102146	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I so appreciate what the Congressman has been doing and I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. Everyone appear favors an assault weapon ban. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations which by the way would have made a huge difference if that was in place and El Paso in that store were all of those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage and certainly in Dayton, Ohio where in 30 seconds one man guns down innocent people. The cops got there in one minute and it still wasn't enough to save those people. That is what unites us. You know what else unites us and I will tell you this what unites us is that right now on Mitch McConnell's desk are three bills universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don't get AK-47s.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102147	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	So if you want to get something done and I personally think we should start with a voluntary--voluntary buyback program. That is my thing, David. You want to finish this because of you one action now, if you want action now we have got to send a message to Mitch McConnell. We can't wait until one of us gets in the White House. We have to pass those bills right now to get this done because we cannot spare another innocent lie.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102148	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	So background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans. 83 percent of Americans agree with licensing. This is the issue. Look, I grew up in the suburbs. It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner-city Newark, New Jersey and witness the aftermath of a shooting. It's one of the reasons why shooting after shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me. It's why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102149	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And I'm happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing. But this is what I'm sorry about. I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming into my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change. This is a crisis of empathy in our nation. We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action. You want to know how we get this done?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102150	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	We get this done by having a more courageous empathy where people don't wait for this hell to visit upon their communities, they stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. I will lead to change--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102151	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	On this issue because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine because we forget national shootings, these--these mass shootings are tragedies. But the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine. Nobody has ascended to the White House will bring more personal passion on this issue. I will fight this and bring fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102152	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	You know, if--if that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights, if it was this idea that we can't get it done because of the situation in the Senate, I'm looking to lead a movement. The number one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry. Think about this, we have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined from the Revolutionary war till now. This is not a side issue to me. It is a central issue to me. That is the kind of fight because the majority of homicide victims, we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine. We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so that we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby. It is time for a movement on this issue, and I will lead it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102153	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So let's start by framing the problem the right way. We have a gun violence problem in this country. The mass shootings are terrible. But they get all the headlines. Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds. People died from violence from suicide and domestic abuse. We have a gun violence problem in this country. And we agree on many steps we can take to fix it. My view on this is we're going to--it's not going to be one and done on this. We're going to do it, and we're going to have to do it again, and we're going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly. But here's the deal. The question we need to ask is when we've got this much support across the country, 90 percent of Americans want to see us do, I like registration, want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the ground--off the streets, why doesn't it happen? And the answer is corruption, pure and simple.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102154	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry and unless we are willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster, we're not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons. And with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster. Until we attack these systemic problems, we can't get gun reform in this country. We've got to go straight against the industry, and we've got to change Congress, so it doesn't just work for the wealthy and well-connected, so it works for the people.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102155	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	No. But what I would support absolutely, is passing major legislation. The gun legislation. The people here are talking about. Medicare for All. Climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen. And you can do it in a variety of ways. You can do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what his appropriate and what is not--what is in order and what is not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102156	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	What I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made that, in fact, in terms of gun issues picking up on Cory and Beto and everybody else--what we are looking at is a corrupt political system and that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what's happening in Washington or in this case, you got an NRA, which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102157	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I am proud. I am proud that year after year I had an F rating from the NRA. And as president I will not be intimidated by the NRA.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102158	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	May I respond.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102159	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Can I--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102160	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Latinos should look at is comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one. We didn't lock people up in cages, we didn't separate families, we didn't do all of those things. Number one.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102161	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two--number two by the time this is a president that came along with a DACA program. No one had ever done that before. This president sent legislation to the desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America. This is a president who has done a great deal, so I'm proud to have served with him.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102162	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed. I would in fact, make sure that there is we immediately surge to the border all those people are seeking asylum. They deserve to be heard. That's who we are. We are a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression you should come. I would change the order that the president just changed saying women who are being beaten and abused can no longer claim that as a reason for asylum. And by the way, retrospectively--you know, the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up. The Republican congress has not reauthorized it. Let's put pressure to pass the Violence Against Women Act now. Let them go back.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102163	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	The president did the best thing that was able to be done--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102164	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I'm the vice president of the United States.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102165	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	You know I--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102166	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Jorge, thank you very much for that question and look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants. He builds his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fear mongering and otherising (PH) migrants and that's very different from Barack Obama.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102167	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	But my problem with Vice President Biden and Cory pointed this out last time is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up he says oh, I was there, I was there, I was there--that's me too. And then, every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of he says well, that was the president. I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama's work but not have to answer to any questions.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102168	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--I don't get that--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102169	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Let me just say.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102170	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	That is not what I said.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102171	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Or a--let me just say--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102172	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--That is not what I said--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102173	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--That I would--I was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan. And you know why? Because I'm not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102174	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	I'm not going to backpedal. I'm not going to pretend like I don't have a--my own vision for immigration. So, we're not going to give up DACA. Were not going to give up protections for anybody. I believe that on January 20th, 2021 we're going to have a Democratic president. Were going to throw out Mitch McConnell--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102175	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--And John Cornyn and have a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House. And we're going to pass immigration reform--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102176	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--Within the first hundred days.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102177	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I did not say I don't stand--I stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad, and indifferent. That's where I stand.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102178	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I did not say I did not stand with him.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102179	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Well, I start with a statement of principles, and that is in this country immigration does not make us weaker. Immigration makes us stronger.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102180	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our Dreamers but also for their grandparents and for their cousins, for people who's overstayed student visas and for people who came here to work in the fields. I want to have a system that is a path to--to citizenship that is fair and achievable.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102181	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Down at the border, we've got to rework this entirely. A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal, and a 12-year-old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer and it is not serving our values.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102182	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We--we need--I want to add one more part on this, because I think we have to look at all the pieces. Why do we have a crisis at the border? In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102183	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We need to restore that help. We need to help establish and reestablish the rule of law so that people don't feel like they have to flee for their lives. We have a crisis that Donald Trump has created and hopes to profit from politically.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102184	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We have to have the courage to stand up and fight back.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102191	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	--With the American people. If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants, and rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities. We have to say to the American people immigrants are positive for our economic and social dynamism. And I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama/Biden administration.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102192	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	I think we have to compete for talent. And I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways. He says build a wall. I'm going to say to immigrants come to America because, if you come here, your son or daughter can run for president. The water is great, and this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life. This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations. If we lose that, we lose something integral to our continued success. And that is where I would lead as president.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102195	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	The only people, though, who actually buy into this president's hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don't know any.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102196	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform. In my community a group of conservative Republicans rallied around in individual, a beloved local individual who was deported when he went into ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out because they never thought it would happen to him.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102197	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	In some of the most conservative rural areas of Iowa I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow and it is why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city. You know the only reason that South Bend is growing right now after years of shrinking is immigration. It is one of the reasons we acted not waiting for Washington to create city issued municipal IDs so that people regardless of immigration status in our city have the opportunity to have the benefits of identification.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102198	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We have an opportunity to actually get something done but we cannot allow this to continue to be the same debate with the same arguments in the same clever lines often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities but our values, values of welcome, values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries their values with our laws.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102199	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	I do and--and if you read the rest of that article in the Washington Post I talked about harmonizing our entry/exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada. I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa overstates but I think the larger question that we are trying to get it is how do we rewrite this country's immigration laws in our own image, in the image of Houston, Texas, the most diverse city in the United States of America.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102200	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	In the image of El Paso, Texas, one of the safest cities in the United States of America, safe not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants, safe because we are a city of immigrants.

1102201	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	I will lead an effort to make sure that we rewrite our immigration laws in that way. Never cage another child. Make sure that there is accountability and justice for these seven lives lost under our care and our custody but also face the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike but it to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job that we have been part of the boarding people hundreds of thousands just in the Obama administration alone who pose no threat to this country, breaking up their families, Democrats have to get off the back foot. We have to lead on this issue because we know it is right. Legalize America, begin with those more than 1 million dreamers, make them U.S. right now in this their true home country--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102202	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	--and extend that to their parents, their sisters and their brothers and ensure that we have a legal, safe, orderly system to come to this country and add to our greatness here.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102203	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	I will not repeal the tariffs on day one but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal because right now the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102204	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated U.S. intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head. And he said one, how can my workers compete against that and two, think about all of the lost revenue to American companies. So the imbalances are real. We have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides. So no to repealing the tariffs immediately but yes to making sure that we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102205	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Well, the President clearly has no strategy. You know when I first got into this race I remember President Trump scoffed and said he would like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping. I would like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102206	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Is it just me or was that supposed to happen in like April? It is one more example of a commitment not made. When that happens on the international stage people take note, not just our competitors, our adversaries but also our allies take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word or follow through on its plans and when that happens there are serious consequences.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102207	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We saw it at the G7. The leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world, climate change, and there was literally an empty chair where American leadership couldn't have been. The problem is this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever whether it is in Hong Kong where those protesters were democracies need to know that they have a friend in the United States or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around. The world needs America but it can't be just any America it has to--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102208	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage but it's not about the tariffs. Look, what is going on right now is the President who has reduce the entire China challenge into a question of tariffs when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else and there is a lack of a bigger strategy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102209	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	What we've got right now though, George, it is not a focused tariffs on steel. What he has done here he has assessed these tariffs on our allies, he has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips and one of his bankrupt casinos and if we are not careful he is going to bankrupt this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102210	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	One forecast recently says that it is already cost us 300,000 jobs. All right? There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest, in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa. So when I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table. That is what I would do. I wouldn't have put all of these tariffs in place and I wouldn't have had a trade policy where on August 1 he announces he is going to have tariffs on $300 billion of goods, on August 13 he cuts it in half, a week later he says he's going to reduce taxes, the day after that he says he is going to do it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102211	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	The leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength as a nation and yes, we want fair trade but we must work with the rest of the world and he has made a mockery of focused trade policy which I think means enforcement like we have done in northern Minnesota passing bills, getting President Obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit so we are importing--exporting goods and making sure that it is a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things, and exporting to the world. He is defeating that goal.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102212	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Well, look, I agree with those who have said that this erratic, haphazard trade war is hurting American families. As Senator Klobuchar said, 300,000 American jobs, it's estimated that it's cost $600 to the average American family. Just a couple of days ago, 60 percent of Americans said that they believe that we are in for a recession next year. So when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war. We have leverage there. I also believe though that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights. We have millions of Uighurs, for instance, in China that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102213	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And in North Korea, this president is elevating a dictator. We need to stop that. We need to return to ensuring that America leads again on human rights. When it comes to this trade war, I would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down. We have leverage in that discussion.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102214	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades. And it has been broken because it works for giant national corporations and not for much of anyone else. These are giant corporations that, shoot, if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country, they'll do it in a heartbeat. And yet, for decades now, who's been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators? Who has shaped our trade policy? It's been the giant corporations. It's been their lobbies lobbyists and their executives. The way we change our trade policy in America is, first, the procedures, who sits at the table. I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table. I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102215	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I want to negotiate it with environmentalists at the table. I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table. And you asked the question about leverage. If I could just respond to that one, leverage, are you kidding? Everybody wants access to the American market. That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America you want to come so goods to American consumers? Then you've got to raise your standards. You've got to raise your labor standards. You've got to raise your environmental standards. So our companies can compete on a level playing field.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102216	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country. We can use trade to help build a stronger economy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102217	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	Well, first of all, I--I have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now, which is that we've got a guy in the White House who has been erratic on trade policy. He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly, born out of his fragile ego. It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soybeans rotting in bins looking at bankruptcy. When we look at this issue, my trade policy under a Harris administration American products is always going to be about saying we need to export, not American jobs. And to do that, we have to have a meaningful trade policy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102218	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	I am not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff, and that means you need to sell it to people overseas. That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen. You asked earlier about China. It's a complicated relationship. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property, the dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102219	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea. I am on, and I think the only person on the stage, the Senate intelligence entity and the Senate Homeland security committee. We need a partner on the issue of North Korea. But the bottom line is this. Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that--that guy in the Wizard of Oz, you know, when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102220	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	(INAUDIBLE)	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102221	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	There is a reason--there is a reason why in the last 45 years the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and worker productivity has stopped making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago. And one of the reasons is that for decades, we have had disastrous trade policies.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102222	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I've got to say to my good friend Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade. I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR, which cost this country over 4 million good paying jobs.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102223	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50 percent of what they made in manufacturing.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102224	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	So, Trump obviously hasn't a clue. Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at 3:00 in the morning. What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere who are losing billions right now because of Trump's policy, a trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad and then thinks that they're going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102225	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	--They got another guess coming.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102226	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Yeah. Well, look, we are either going to make policy or China's going to make the trade--the rules of the road. We make up 25 percent of the world economy. We need another 25 percent to join us. And I think Eliza--Senator Warren is correct. At the table has to be labor and at the table has to be environmentalists.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102227	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	The fact of the matter is China--the problem is in the trade deficit. The problem is they are stealing our intellectual property. The problem is they're violating the WTO. They're dumping steel on us. That's a different issue than whether or not there dumping agricultural products on us.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102228	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	In addition to that, we're in a position where, if we don't set the rules, we in fact are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And that's why you need to organize the world to take on China to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102229	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Sure. There's a one point we're really missing on the stage right now, which is the fact that Donald Trump's America First policy is actually and America isolated, and America alone policy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102230	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Exactly right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102231	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	From trade to--to battling China to the climate--global crisis of climate change, the challenges in the Middle East, he is pulling us away from our allies; out of the Iran deal, out of the Paris Climate Accords. And on trade, he's deciding to take on China while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102232	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. Now, look, I'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102233	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	But they are not a national security threat. We cannot go up against China alone. This is a president that has a better relationship with the dictators like Duarte and Putin than he does with Merkel and Macron. We are the strongest nation on the planet Earth--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102234	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--And our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose. That's how we be China. That's how we be climate change on the planet Earth. And that's how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers rights.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102235	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Yes. And I'll tell you why. What we're doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States. It is not helping the safety and security of the world. It is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan. We need to bring our troops home.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102236	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	And then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102237	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We're not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan. We need to treat the problem of terrorism is a worldwide problem, and that means we need to be working with all of our allies, our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America. We need to work together to root out terrorism.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102238	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	It means using all of our tools. It means economic investment. It means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the State Department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and tears in many of these countries. We need a foreign policy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102239	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	That is about our security and about leading on our values.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102240	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer--I think it may have been Senator McCain's last trip before he was sick. And, I talked to people--we did--we talked to military leaders American and local leaders. We talked to people on the ground and asked the questions same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee, every time one of the generals comes through--show me what winning looks like--tell me what it looks like. And what you hear is a lot of (INAUDIBLE). Because no one can describe it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102241	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	And, the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military. I have three older brothers who have served in the military--I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made. They will do anything we ask them to do, but we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve. We need to work with the rest of the world. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools. We need to build with our allies and we need to make the whole world safer not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102242	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	You know, I served under General Dunford way under General Dunford, in Afghanistan.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102243	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	And, today, September 12th, 2019 means that today you could be 18 years old--old enough to serve and have not been alive on 9/11. We have got to put an end to endless war. And the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland and that does not require an open ended commitment of ground troops.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102244	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Let me say something else because if there's one thing we've learned about Afghanistan--from Afghanistan it's that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102245	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	And so, when I am president an authorization for a use of military force will have a built in three year sunset. Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to congress to seek an authorization. Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas the least our members of congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there. By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props or worse--tools for his own enrichment.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102246	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	We saw what's going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels. I'll tell you--as a military officer the very first thing that goes through your mind, the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you are responsible for in uniform--is do not let these men and women down. This president is doing exactly that. I will not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102247	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	No, it was (INAUDIBLE) wrong to pull out. I want to answer the Afghanistan question. I've been in and out of Afghanistan--not with a gun. And I admire my friend for his service. But I've been in and out of Afghanistan more than anybody on this--on this--and it's an open secret you reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan. The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency meaning that we're going to put that country together. It cannot be put together. Let me--let me say it again--it will not be put together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102248	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	It's three different countries--Pakistan owns the three counties the--the three provinces in the east. They are not any part of it. The economy is running--I can go on and on but here's the point--the point is that it's a counter terrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases and insist that Pakistanis provide bases for us to air--airlift from and to move against what we know. We don't need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford is a fine guy but this has been an internal argument we've had for eight years.

1102249	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	With regard to--with regard to Iraq--the fact of the matter is you know, I should have never voted to give Bush the authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the security council to vote 15 to nothing to allow inspectors to go in and determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102250	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	and when that happened he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof. I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on. What I was argued against in the beginning fronts once he started to put the troops in was that in fact we were doing it the wrong way, there was no plan. We should not be engaged. We didn't have the people with us. We didn't have our alliance, we didn't have allies with us, etc. And it was later when we came into office that Iraq turned--the President turned to me and said Joe, when they said we've got a plan to get out he turned to the whole security said simply Joe will organize this, get the troops home. My son spent a year in Iraq and I understand it--and we were right to get the combat troops out.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102251	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	The big mistake that was made which we predicted was that they would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from coming--from moving in. (INAUDIBLE)	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102252	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	David, let me answer that but let me just comment on something that the vice president said. You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge. The truth is the big mistake, the huge mistake in one of the big differences between you and me I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102253	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	You are right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102254	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I voted against the war in Iraq and help lead the opposition and it's sad to say. I mean I kind of had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war. As the former Chairman of the Senate committee on Veterans Affairs I want to pick up on what Pete said. We cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend--defend us, who have responded to the call of duty. But I think also I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of trumps military budgets.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102255	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I don't think we have to spend $750 billion a year on the military when we don't even know who our enemy is.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102256	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together, bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism and make it clear that we as a planet, as a global community, will work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism by dropping bombs on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102257	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	I signed a pledge to in the forever wars. We have been in a state of continuous armed conflict for 18 years which is not what the American people want.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102258	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	We have to start owning what we can and can't do. We are not very good at rebuilding countries and if you want proof all you have to do is look within our own country at Puerto Rico. We have spent trillions of dollars to unclear benefits, lost thousands of lives and thank you Pete for your service and the goal has to be to rebuild the relationships that have made America strong for decades. I would lead our Armed Forces with the restraint and judgment. With the American people one is simply a President who has the right values and point of view and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harm's way and that is what I would do as President	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102259	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Well, first of all let me be very clear anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant. What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make and can create their own future.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102260	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	In terms of democratic socialism to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe is extremely unfair.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102261	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	--Tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism. I agree with what goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102262	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102263	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage and that we expand the trade union movement.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102264	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	I happen to believe also that what, to me, democratic socialism means is we deal with an issue, we do not discuss in a foyer, not in the media, and not in Congress. You've got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country. You've got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies, and in the media. Maybe, just me and maybe, what we should be doing is creating an economy that works for all of us, not 1 percent. That's my understanding of democratic socialism.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102265	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Sure. Thank you, Jorge. I'll call Maduro a dictator because he is a dictator.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102266	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And while we need to do is to, along with our allies, make sure that the Venezuelan people get the assistance that they need, that we continue to pressure Venezuela so that they'll have free and fair elections, and also here in the United States, offer temporary protected status, TPS to Venezuelans.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102267	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do. For all have his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan American community, he has failed. I will not. I also believe that we need to do things like a 21st century Marshall plan for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala so that people can find safety--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102268	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States. And, under my administration, we're going to put renewed focus on Latin America. It makes sense. They are our neighbors and we have a lot of things in common. It also makes sense that--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102269	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--That because we have a country like China that is going around the world to places like Africa and Latin America making their own relationships, strengthening those, United States needs to strengthen its partnerships in Latin America immediately. And I will.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102270	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	You know, first of all, I want to say no. Actually, I want to translate that into Spanish. No.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102271	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Look, on--let's just be clear, the factory farming going on that's assaulting this corporate consolidation, the agriculture industry, one of the reasons why I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment. You see independent family farmers being pushed out a business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that don't line up with our values. That's what I'm calling for.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102272	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	But I want to--I want to switch because we don't have a crowded debate stage, we were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq, it--it annoys me that we have a conversation about our troops overseas and we didn't say one word about veterans in our country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102273	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	We have a shameful reality in America that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds, hurts, and harms. They are disproportionately homeless. You hear stories about women waiting for months or gynecological care through the VA. It is very important that as we as a country understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us. We end our national anthem home of the brave. It's about time we make this a better home for our bravest.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102274	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Yes, we will follow through regardless of the political consequences or who it offends because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it. We will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050, that we are halfway there by 2030, that we mobilize $5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that, that we invest here in Houston, Texas with pre-disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding. Given the fact that this town has seen three 500 year floods--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102275	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	In just five years, you'd like to think you're good for 1500 years, but you're not. They're coming faster and larger and more devastating than ever. We are also going to make sure that we free ourselves from dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology, as well as the high-paying, high skill, high wage jobs that come along with that. And then we're going to pay farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102276	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Cover crops, keeping more land under conservation. Using no till farming, regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil. That's the way that were going to meet this challenge and we're going to bring everyone into the solution.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102277	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	Thank you. This is the existential crisis of our time. It's--you know that movie the Day After Tomorrow? It's today. We have seen a warming in our world like never before. We are seeing flooding in the Midwest, flooding in Houston fires in the West.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102278	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	And I think having someone leading the ticket from the Midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done. On day one, I will get us back into the International Climate Change Agreement.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102279	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	On day two, I will bring back the clean power rules that President Obama had worked on. And on day three, I will bring back the gas mileage standards. You can do all that without Congress, which is good. On day four, five, and six, I will, working with Congress and mayors and businesspeople all over the country, introduced sweeping legislation to get at that 2050--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102280	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	--Goal. And on day seven you're supposed to rest, but I won't.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102281	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	This is what we need to do if we're going to get at climate change. We have to take this on as a crisis that's happening right now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102282	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Yes. We need to work on every front on climate change. It is the threat to every living thing on this planet and we are running out of time. Every time the scientists go back, they say we have less and less time than we thought we had. But that means we got to use all the tools.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102283	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools. I have proposed, following Governor Inslee, that we by 2028 cut all carbon emissions from new buildings, by 2030 carbon emissions from cars, and by 2035 all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity. That alone, those three, will cut our emissions here in the United States by 70 percent. We can do this.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102284	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	We also need to help around the world to clean, but understand this one more time. Why doesn't it happen?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102285	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future, we can make the changes we need to make. We have to attack corruption head on so that we can save our planet.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102286	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	When I think about this issue, it really is through the lens of my baby nieces, who are one and a half and three years old. When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing when they turn 20, I am really scared. And when I've been in the United States Senate for now the last two and half years and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children. And then when they look at the mirror, I don't know what they see, but it's a lack of courage.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102287	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And these--this is an issue that, yes, it represents an existential threat. It is also something we can do something about. And this is a problem that was created by human behaviors, and we can change our behaviors in a way that saves our planet. I've seen it happen.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102288	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	In California, I took on--as the Attorney General of California, I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. I took on the big oil companies and we saw progress. If any of you have been to Los Angeles--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102289	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--Twenty years ago, you'll remember that sky was brown. You go there now, the sky is blue. And you know why? Because leaders decided to lead, and we took on these big fossil fuel companies. We have some of the most important and strongest laws--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102290	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--In the country, and we made a difference. And my point being I've done it before and I will lead as president on this issue because we have no time. The clock is tipping--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102291	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--Ticking, but--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102292	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--We need courage and we need courageous leadership. We can get this done.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102293	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	So to follow up on what Elizabeth said, why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102294	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	--Yeah--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102295	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	--Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA? And the answer is this. We all know, everyone on this stage knows, that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests. Now, everyone here has a plan to try and curb those corporate interests, but we have to face facts.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102296	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Money finds a way. The money will find its way back in. So, what is the answer? The answer is to wash the money out with a people powered money.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102297	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	My proposal is that we give every American 100 democracy dollars that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like. This would wash out the lobbyist cash by a factor of eight to one. That is the only way we will win. And as someone running for president, I'll tell you there is the people on one side and the money on the other. The only way for us to win is if we bring them together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102298	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Let me be clear, I am pro-good school. I've got a kid one of my little boys just started public school last weekend I was not there because I was running for president.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102299	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	So we need to pay teachers more because the data clearly shows that a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102300	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized test which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human worth.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102301	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	But here is the big one, the data clearly shows that 65 percent to 70 percent of our students outcomes are determined outside of the school. We are talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they are young, stress levels in the house, income, type of neighborhood. We are putting money into schools and educators know this, we are saying you are 100 percent responsible for educating our kids but you can only control 30 percent. They all know this, the answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn and our teachers the chance to teach.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102302	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	Step one is a point a Secretary of Education new actually believes in public education.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102303	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I believe in public education and in order to strengthen it some things are very complex for preparing for a future where knowledge is that at your fingertips but we have got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning. Some of it is extremely simple, we have just got to pay teachers more. And we have got to lift up the teaching profession.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102304	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I always think of a story from South Bend of friends who host exchange students from Japan. They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher and they kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college. She took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well and she came up just short. So you know what she did since she was academically good but couldn't quite make the cut to be a teacher? She had a fallback--fallback plan, she became a doctor. That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102305	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	If we want to get the results that we expect for our children we have to support and compensate the teaching profession respected teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102306	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	You know, I think I'm the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102307	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in second grade. And let's be clear in all of the ways we talk about this money for public schools should stay in public schools not go anywhere else.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102308	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I have already made my commitment. I will--we will have a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102309	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I think this is ultimately about our values. I have proposed a two cent wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1 percent in this country. That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal childcare for every baby age 0 to 5, universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in this country--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102310	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	--raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country, cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who have got it--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102311	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	And strengthen our unions. This is how we build an America that reflects our values not just where the money comes from with the billionaires and corporate executives.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102312	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	My first grade teacher Mrs. Francis Wilson, God rest her soul attended my law school graduation. I think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us. I have offered in this campaign a proposal to deal with this which will be the first in the nation federal investment in closing the teacher pay gap which is $13,500 a year because right now in our public schools are teachers 94 percent of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102313	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And that is wrong. I also want to talk about where we are here at TS you and what it means in terms of HBCUs. I have as part of my proposal that we will put $2 trillion into investing in our HBCUs for teachers--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102314	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	--because--because--because one, as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102315	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	-- I will say--I will say that it is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these many professions but also--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102316	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	But this is a critical point	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102317	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	If a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade they are 13 percent more likely to go to college.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102318	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	If that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade they are 32 percent more likely to go to college. So, when we talk about investing in our public education system it is at the source of so much when we fix it that will fix so many other things. We must invest in the (INAUDIBLE).	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102319	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And I strongly believe you can judge a society based on how it treats its children and we are (INAUDIBLE) on this issue.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102320	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Guess what?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102321	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	You're guessing, all right--now, here's the answer--we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world and yet we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on earth. We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they can't work two or three jobs to support themselves.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102322	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	That's right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102323	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Which is why under my legislation we will move to see that every teacher in America makes at least $60,000 a year.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102324	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	What we will also do is not only have universal pre-K we will make public colleges and universities and HBCUs debt free.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102325	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	And what we will also do because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need--we are going to cancel all student debt in this country.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102326	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	We are going to do that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102327	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Well, they have to deal with the--look--there is institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved I started dealing with that--redlining, banks, making sure that we are in a position where look--you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools the Title 1 schools--triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to 45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise an equal raise of getting out the $60,000 level.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102328	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Number two, make sure we bring in the help (INAUDIBLE) the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home we need--we have one school psychologist for every 1500 kids in America today. It's crazy. The teachers are (INAUDIBLE) I'm married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have to make sure that every single child does, in fact, have three, four and five year olds go to school. School. Not daycare. School. We bring social workers into homes of parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102329	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	It's not that they don't want help. They don't know quite what to do. Play the radio. Make sure the television--excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night the--the phone. Make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school--a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there. There is so much we can--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102330	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	No, I'm going to go like the rest of them do--twice over. Ok?	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102331	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Because here's the deal--the deal is that we've got this little backwards. And by the way, in Venezuela we should be allowing people to come here form Venezuela. I know Maduro, I've confronted Maduro. Number two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America--I'm the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries in fact, change their system so people don't have a chance. You all are acting like we just discovered this yesterday.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102332	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Thank you very much--well that's--that's quite a lot. But--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102333	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	You know, I grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about in a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation. In fact, in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case challenging how Texas financed its schools. And, I know that today, our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102334	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	Right.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102335	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Now, I have an education plan like a lot of folks up here that would pay teachers more, that would recruit diverse ranks of teachers, that would invest in our public schools. But I also believe that we have to connect the dots to uplift the quality of life--to invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED and healthcare opportunities. And those things that truly, truly ensure that the entire family can prosper.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102336	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Those are the types of things that we need to do in addition to lifting up our public schools. You asked a second ago about charter schools. Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools. They're not.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102337	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And so--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102338	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	--While I'm not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them that is required right now.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102339	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	So, I'm--I'm hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that--and the way we talk about communities of color. Look, I--I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line. I lived in public housing projects almost for a decade and saw the anguish of the parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don't have a school that serves their genius.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102340	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	I think I'm the only person on the stage, even though I had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system, I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools and we produced results. A lot of folks here talking about raising teacher's salary. We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102341	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And we didn't stop there. Yeah, we closed for performing charter schools but, dagnabbit, we expanded high-performing charter schools. We were a city that said we need to find local solutions that worked for our community. The results speak for themselves. We are now the number one city in America for a beat the odds of the schools, from high poverty to high-performance.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102342	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	Strategies like investing in our children work. And I'll tell you this. I--I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from other issues. That's why my friend, Secretary Castro, is 100 percent right. We are in the reality we are right now because, vice president, of overtly racist policies not 400 years ago, just in my lifetime, that we are redlining communities, dis-investing in communities. And more than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation in housing and--and the challenges of underfunded schools, but they're also struggling with environmental injustice.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102343	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	If you talk to someone who's a parent of a child who's had permanent brain damage because of lead, you'll know this is a national problem, because there's over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102344	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And so, if I'm president of the United States, it is a holistic solution to education from raising teacher's salary, fully funded special education, but combating the issues of poverty, combating the issues of racial segregation, combating the issues of a criminal justice system--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102345	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--That takes parents away from their kids, and dealing with environmental justice as a major pillar of any climate policy.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102346	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I--I never count any professional setback I have as a serious setback. There's things that are important, things that are unimportant.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102347	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	I--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102348	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	--I'm sorry.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102349	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	There's setbacks and there's setbacks. And I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose--well, my dad had an expression. He said Joe, it's not a question of succeeding whether you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. And--and he he'd say--he'd you never explain and never complain. And then he'd go on to say that the only obligation that really matters, the most important thing is family. It's why I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything, family. And you could be judged on how you treat your family and how you went from there.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102350	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	And I--it took--you know, Kierkegaard said faith sees best in the dark. Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automatic automobile accident and my--and my two sons were badly injured and I'd just been elected, not sworn in. And I lost my faith for a while. I came back. And then later, when my send son Bo (SP) came from home from Iraq and with a terminal disease and a year later--a year and half later losing him was like losing part of my soul. But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose. Purpose and what you do.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102351	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Joe Biden	2019-09-12	And that's why I hope--I hope he's proud of me today because he wanted to make sure I'd didn't run for president but I stayed engaged because when you get hit badly, whether you're losing a job or you're raising a family my dad where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid you can't live here anymore, dad lost his job, you know, we--we've all been through that in some form or another. But it just takes--it just, for me, the way I've dealt with it is finding purpose. And my purpose is to do what I've always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy and--but there's a lot of people who been through a lot worse than I have, get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another without the help I had. They are real heroes out there. Real heroes.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102352	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	I'm mentioned earlier I've known what I wanted to be since second grade. I wanted to be a public school teacher. And I invested early. I used to line my dollies up and teach school. I had a reputation for being tough but fair.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102353	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn't have money for to send me off to four years at the University. And my story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. I got a scholarship college application, much less and then, at 19, got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over. I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston and I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies look like. I had four--I had four to six-year-olds.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102354	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back of the day, that meant that the principal said to me--wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. So there I am. I'm at home, I've got a baby, I can't have a job. What am I going to do? Here's resilience. I said I'll go to law school. And the consequence was I practice law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love, which is teaching. But let me get into fights, it gave me new tools. And the reason I'm standing here today is because I got back up, I fought back. I know what's broken. I want to be in the fight to fix it in America. That's--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102355	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Elizabeth Warren	2019-09-12	Why I am here.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102356	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	Resilience to me means growing up in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. Professional resilience means to me, George, running for U.S. Senate in Vermont and getting 1 percent of the vote, running for governor and getting 2 percent of the vote, finally becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont, with 10 vote margin. What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country. Whether it is Wall Street--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102357	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Bernie Sanders	2019-09-12	--whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex. And I feel confident that given a lifelong record of taking on powerful special interest, of standing up for the working families of this country that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that work for all of us not just the 1 percent.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102358	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	You know, every office I have run for whether it be district attorney or attorney general I was told each time it can be done. They said nobody like you has done it before, you are--nobody is ready for you. When I ran for DA I want and became the first black woman elected DA in a state of 40 million people in San Francisco. When I ran for Atty. Gen. of California I was elected because I didn't listen and I was the only black elected woman black elected attorney general in the state--in the country. And each time people would say it's not your time, it's not your turn, it's going to be too difficult, they are not ready for you and I didn't listen and a part of it probably comes from the fact that I was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me including don't you ever let anybody tell you who you are, you tell them who you are.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102359	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Kamala Harris	2019-09-12	And when I look around the town halls that we do in this race for President of the United States and I look at the--the meetings that we do and the community meetings and I see these little girls and boys sometimes even brought by their fathers and they bring them to me and I talk to them during these events and they smile and they are full of joy and their fathers tell them see don't you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be you have to believe what can be unburdened by what has been.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102360	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	You know as a military officer serving under don't ask don't tell and as an elected official in the state of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor at a certain point when it came to professionals setbacks I had to wonder whether just acknowledging who I was was going to be the ultimate career ending professional setback.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102361	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Pete Buttigieg	2019-09-12	I came back from the deployment and realize that you only get to live one life and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer so I just came out. I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially conservative community. What happened was when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them they decided to trust me and reelected me with 80 percent of the vote and what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what is worth more to you than winning. And I think that is what we need in the presidency right now. We have to know what we are about in this election is not about any of us up here, it is not about this president even though it is hard to talk of anything else some days. It is about the people who trust us with their lives. The kid wondering if we are actually going to make their schools safe when they have learned active shooter drills before they have learned to read; a generation wondering whether we will actually get the job done on climate change	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC

1102363	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	I was an unhappy lawyer for five full months and I left to start a business. And I'm going to share with you all one of the secrets entrepreneurship. If you want to start something, tell everyone you know you're going to do it, and then you don't have a choice. You put your heart and soul into it.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102364	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	And even though I did that, my company flopped, had it's a mini rise and maximum fall. I lost investors, hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed 100,000 in school debt. My parents still told people I was a lawyer. I guess it was a little easier.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102365	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	So, I remember lying--lying on my floor looking up, wondering how it had come to this. Eventually, I picked myself back up. I kept working in small growth companies for another 10 years, and eventually had some success.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102366	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	Then after I did have some success, I still remember how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you. And so, I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that help train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Nguyen (PH), who's here in the audience tonight, who left--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102367	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	--Who left his gilded Wall Street job to be--to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio. Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102368	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Andrew Yang	2019-09-12	But the goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102369	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	so, I--my biggest professional setback is--is embarrassing because a lot of folks know about it. I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey in 2002 took on the political machine. And boy, did they fight back. I had tires on my car slashed. Our campaign offices were broken into. My phones were tapped. It became a spectacle and we lost that election.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102370	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	And here's a bit of advice to everybody. If you're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for--	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102371	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	--An Oscar-nominated documentary called Street Fight. But then, unfortunately, another setback. It lost in the Oscars to a movie called March of the dagnabbed Penguins, for crying out loud.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102372	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	The people in my community, was living in the projects, told me don't give up on the people and the people won't give up on you. Create bigger and bolder coalitions and you're going to win. And you know what? We came back four years later and one of the largest lopsided victory in our city's history. But more than that, the lesson was there.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102373	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	We didn't give up. We were taking on America's toughest problems from crime to poverty, and we transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system. There's more work to do, but I haven't given up on the people. I still live in that community.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102374	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	But this is the big lesson. My staff and that my friends and my community told me, if you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor's race, but that's not what life is about. There is an old African saying that says if you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102375	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Cory Booker	2019-09-12	The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people, because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power. And the test of America right now, it's not a referendum on Donald Trump. It's a referendum on us and who we are and who we are going to be together. We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose. And then there's nothing we can't do together as a nation.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102376	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Thank you, George. Everything that I've learned about resilience I've learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas. In the face of this act of--of terror that was directed at our community in large part by the president of the United States that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that nor were we defined by that.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102377	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us to set the example for the rest of this country. We don't see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous. We see them as foundational to our success, to our strength, and to our security into our safety.

1102378	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	Yesterday I was visiting with one of those victims. He's the head coach of the Fusion. This is a girls soccer team of 10 and 11-year-old girls. His name is Luis. He was shot in the legs multiple times. He was shot in the side multiple times. He's still healing from his wounds in the hospital. But from his hospital bed, he still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team. Nimmo (PH) his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital. Those two men, Jessica (PH) and Marcella (PH), their wives, they exemplify resilience to me.

1102379	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Beto O'Rourke	2019-09-12	And when we in this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we're defined not by our fears but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set.

1102380	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	My challenges and resilience have brought me up here. I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life and after his third DWI he had a choice between jail and treatment. He chose treatment with his faith, with his friends, with our family and his words he was pursued by grace. And that made me interested in public service because I feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102381	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	I then, got married. My husband is out there somewhere hopefully smiling. And our daughter--and our daughter was born I had this expectation we are going to have this perfect birth and she was really sick. And she couldn't swallow. And she was in and out of hospitals for a year and a half. But when she was born they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours. She was in intensive care and I was kicked out. And I thought, this could never happen to any other mom again. So, I went to the legislature, our state legislator not an elected official--a mom and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48 hour hospital stay.

1102382	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Amy Klobuchar	2019-09-12	And, when they tried to delay the implementation of that law I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyists two to one. And when they said, want you to take place they all raised their hand and said no. That is what motivated me to go into public service. And when I got to that gridlock of Washington D.C. and got to work and pass over 100 bills and I know a lot of my friends form the left--but remember I am from the middle of the country. And I believe that if we're going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit. Someone who is not just going to change the policies but change the tone in the country. And someone who believes in America and believes it from the heart because of where they came from. That everyone should have that same opportunity.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102383	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	In many ways, I shouldn't be here on this stage, you know, Castro is my mother's name and was my grandmother's name before her. I grew up in a single parent household on the west side of San Antonio, going to the public schools eventually my brother Joaquin and I became the first in our family to become professionals.

1102384	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And, when I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town. I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000. A few months later I got elected to the San Antonio City Council and the City Council at the time was only pay $1040 a year. So, everybody had another job and my job was at the law firm.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102385	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	Well, a few months after I got elected the law firm got a client. And the client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didn't think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I want dot vote against it. And my constituents wanted me to vote against it. But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas, cause believe it or not lawyers have ethics rules. You can't just go against the interest of a client.

1102386	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	So, I was stuck. On the one hand I wanted to do the right thing. On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment depended on me shutting up--being conflicted out. So, one day I walked into my law firm and I quit my job. And then, I went and I voted against that land deal on the city council.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102387	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	And, you know, it was the first test that I had and I think back to that because often times we think of politics and you think of politics as dirty or corrupting. I wondered before I went in whether it would change who I was. And I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent and not for big special interests. There is nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the president of the United States.	Democratic Presidential Debate - September 12 | ABC
1102388	ABC HOSTS 2019 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATES IN HOUSTON	Julian Castro	2019-09-12	This president has failed that test. But I want you to know that if you elect me president I won't. I won't serve anybody except you and your family. And together, we can create an America that's better than ever. Thank you very much.
